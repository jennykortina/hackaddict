One of the crappier bundled programs is the calendar app.  Not only did it take me a few days to figure out the best way to import my google calendar events onto my phone, which I will address in a later post, (I tried about five different methods) but once I got them onto my phone they were pretty much useless.  My calendars were no longer color coded leaving every event looking exactly the same, a grey triangle in the upper right hand corner of the calendar day.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pi&amp;">Enter Pocket Informant 2007.</a>  Not only does it keep my calendars color coded, but it launches into the view that you closed it in (ie, I like having my calendar open to a month view so I can quickly see any upcoming events - I couldn't figure out how to do that in the built in calendar app).<br/><br/>At $24.95 <a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pi&amp;">Pocket Informant</a> is a steal.  It has so many features that even after a week of use I am still discovering new ones.   I highly recommend giving <a href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/products_info.php?p_id=pi&amp;">Pocket Informant</a> a try if you're as fed up with the windows mobile calendar  app as  I was.<br/><br/><a href="http://download.pocketinformant.com/7/CAB/">Download a cab for Pocket Informant here.</a>
