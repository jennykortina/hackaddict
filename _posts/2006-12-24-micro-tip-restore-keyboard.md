title: 'Micro Tip: Restore Keyboard Functionality in Firefox'
---

Sometimes when I am in Firefox my keyboard stops working.  I can't type anything into the address bar or anywhere else in the browser.  I mentioned it to my brother and he has the same problem and told me how to fix it:<br /><br />Alt-tab out of Firefox and into another program.   Then alt-tab back into Firefox and your keyboard will work again.<br /><br />Thanks Andrew!
