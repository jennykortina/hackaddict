title: 3d Printing Basic Tools of the Trade Part 2
---

As a follow up to <a href="/2013/02/3d-printing-basic-tools-of-trade.html">3d Printing Basic Tools of the Trade</a>:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://cloud.netfabb.com/">Netfab STL Repairer</a></b> - this amazing free little web utility repairs your STLs making sure all the surfaces are connected and the model is solid.  I run all my models through it pre-print. </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/3M-ScotchBlue-Painters-3-Inch-1-Roll/dp/B001EJMS4M"><b>Painters tape</b></a> - cover build plate with this to help model sticking and protect plate.  The wider the better </li>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Painting-Knife-5-Piece/dp/B000YQ87B4">Pallet knife</a> </b>- used to pry the model off the build platform.  Works amazingly well.  I bought mine at local art store, but here's a set of similar ones for cheap on amazon </li>
  <li><b>Rubbing alcohol</b> - use when printing models that have small foot prints to improve sticking.  Using: you rub the build plate (even if it's covered in painters tape) down with this pre-print.  It makes the model stick MUCH better, so it should only be used if you have a model with a small surface area touching the build plate.</li>
</ul>
