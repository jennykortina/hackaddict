title: 'Quick Tip: Keep You''re Mac Awake'
---

I watch a lot of videos on various sites including youtube, google video, etc., and one of my main gripes with the sites is that video does not make your mac think it is busy so it constantly falls asleep while playing a single clip.<br/><br/>In comes the freeware ap <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a>:<br/><br/>"Caffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar. Click it to prevent your Mac from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers. Click it again to go back. Hold down the Command key while clicking to show the menu."<br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5046203143645288994" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2007-03-26-image-0000.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5046203281084242482" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2007-03-26-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/><br/>Very cool ap so far, and now I don't have to use a custom battery setting to keep my mac awake.  I love less work!<br/><br/><a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine can be downloaded here.</a>
