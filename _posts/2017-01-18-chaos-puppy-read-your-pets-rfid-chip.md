title: Chaos Puppy - Read Your Pet's RFID Chip
---

Most pets have an RFID chip in them so when they are lost it can be scanned and the owners information can be retrieved.  I would like to harness the power of this RFID technology to allow my pet, Chewie, to control my house and update her <a href="https://twitter.com/chewie">Twitter</a>.
  
I've learned that pet RFID transmits at 125 kHz.  I had an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/789?gclid=CjwKEAiAwfzDBRCRmJe7z_7h8yQSJAC4corOJONSGGLzh3dEtnacayOyRUu6bWYM0J6RAjbVgVL-JhoCvTnw_wcB">RFID reader</a> lying around from Adafruit, that I doubted and confirmed could not read Chewie's RFID chip.  I've order a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J9AYFGG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">125 kHz Arduino </a>compatible reader that should arrive on Friday.  Will update blog in a few days with the results of the new reader.
  
Github project <a href="https://github.com/jennykortina/chaosPuppy">here</a>.  Until next time.
