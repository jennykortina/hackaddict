As you know I work for a company where I run laser engravers.  For things to engrave correctly they need to be in a vectorized format.  Vectors are images that can be scaled to any size  and remain clean, not pixelated.  Here is a list of sites I use regularly to get good artwork:<br/><a href="http://www.dafont.com/"><br/>Dafont</a> - not technically a vector site, but the fonts on it are all vector images.  Good place to get fonts and pictures.<br/><a href="http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/">Brands of the World </a>- has a ton of copyrighted logos.  Everything from Nintendo to Nike.<br/><a href="http://www.vectorportal.com/">Vectorportal</a> - kinda sucks, but sometimes has good random pics.<br/><br/>If you have any more please feel free to submit to them.
