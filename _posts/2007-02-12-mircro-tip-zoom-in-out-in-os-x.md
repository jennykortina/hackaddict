Many people don't know about this nifty little feature in OS X but you can zoom in and out on  any screen in OS X.  While holding control and either scrolling on a mouse wheel or with two fingers on a compatabile laptop touchpad  you can start zooming (note that from a normal view you can only zoom in - one zoomed in you can zoom back out to normal view).
