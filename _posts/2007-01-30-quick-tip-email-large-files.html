My job often involves emailing large files ie artwork, pictures which would not be a problem if everyone used gmail; however, I often get files bounced back  because they are too large for the recipient to accept.<br/><br/>My first solution was FTP, but my brother said that makes your website less secure so he suggested <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Dropsend</a>.  Dropsend was a great utitlity; however, if you wanted to send more than 5 files you have to sign up and pay monthly fees.  I then did a quick Google search for viable alternatives and came up with <a href="http://www.youswap.com">Youswap</a>.  Youswap is a completely free service that lets you email as many files as you would like.<br/><br/><a href="http://http://www.youswap.com/index.php?area=video_tour">Check out a video of other Youswap features.</a><br/><br/>***YouSwap is currently in beta so you can only send files right now unless you get accepted into the beta invite.***
