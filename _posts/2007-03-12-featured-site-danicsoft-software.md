<span style="font-size:100%;">I was on the apple blog the other reading an article on the best screencast options for mac.  They listed three options including <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">snapz pro</a>, which was the best, and they also mentioned a freeware option <a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/copernicus/">Copernicus.</a><br /><br />I went to check out the free software and ended up finding the developer's site to be badass.  They offer four freeware softwares including:<br /></span><ul><li><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/apexracing/">Apex Racing</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> - Race your car down the track while avoiding the obstacles.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/copernicus/">Copernicus</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> - Screen capture and screen movies, all in one.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/deskcover/">DeskCover</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> - Cover your busy desktop to make your icons more readable.</span></li><li><span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/tunestimer/">TunesTimer</a></span><span style="font-size:100%;"> - How long have you been listening to your iTunes?</span></li></ul>                                                                                          <span style="font-size:100%;">The only program I have personally used is Apex racing which was awesome.  It reminded me of highschool and my TI-83.  Anyway, the site is definitely worth a look and I am going to try out all the software when time allows.</span>
