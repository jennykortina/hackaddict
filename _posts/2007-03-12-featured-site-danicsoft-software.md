 I was on the apple blog the other reading an article on the best screencast options for mac.  They listed three options including <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">snapz pro</a>, which was the best, and they also mentioned a freeware option <a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/copernicus/">Copernicus.</a>



I went to check out the free software and ended up finding the developer's site to be badass.  They offer four freeware softwares including:

 <ul><li> <a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/apexracing/">Apex Racing</a>   - Race your car down the track while avoiding the obstacles. </li><li> <a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/copernicus/">Copernicus</a>   - Screen capture and screen movies, all in one. </li><li> <a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/deskcover/">DeskCover</a>   - Cover your busy desktop to make your icons more readable. </li><li> <a href="http://danicsoft.com/projects/tunestimer/">TunesTimer</a>   - How long have you been listening to your iTunes? </li></ul>  The only program I have personally used is Apex racing which was awesome.  It reminded me of highschool and my TI-83.  Anyway, the site is definitely worth a look and I am going to try out all the software when time allows.
