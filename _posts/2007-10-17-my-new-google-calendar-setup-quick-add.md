As soon as I saw the new <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gcalcli/" title="gcalcli - Google Code">Google Calendar command line interface</a> I decided to give Google Calendar another chance.  Previously, I had ditched it in favor of <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/" title="Get organized and stay organized: Backpack">Backpack</a>--I tried using both for sending myself timely SMS reminders and found that the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/business/backpack.html" title="Apple - Downloads - Dashboard Widgets - Backpack">Backpack Dashboard Widget</a> made entry easier.  I like not having to go to a web page to do something like create a reminder for myself if I can help it.<br /><br />One thing I found annoying about the Backpack widget was the way you set the time for the reminder using a dropdown. (I also like not using my mouse if I can help it.)<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/Rxa2RGi-KwI/AAAAAAAAAGA/9OrsCRIuD5w/s1600-h/Picture+3.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/Rxa2RGi-KwI/AAAAAAAAAGA/9OrsCRIuD5w/s400/Picture+3.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5122482031111842562" /></a><br />I went back to give Google Calendar another shot when the command line interface came out because I knew it had an awesome "Quick Add" feature which allows you to enter reminders like "7:30pm tomorrow get a beer with EJ"--much faster than using dropdown menus.  I got everything setup nicely, and I have to say that capturing reminders is even easier than with the Basecamp widget.<br /><br />Here's my setup:<h4>Calendar Settings</h4>One of the first things I tweaked before I even started messing with <b>gcalcli</b> was my Google Calendar notification settings.  Go to Google Calender and click the dropdown next to your default calendar in the left pane and choose <b>Notifications</b> to change your reminder settings.  I chose to have events default to sending me an Email and SMS 5 minutes before an event occurs, as well as a popup notification an hour before the event.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/Rxa1Xmi-KvI/AAAAAAAAAF4/0Jv6fjKsh08/s1600-h/Picture+4.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/Rxa1Xmi-KvI/AAAAAAAAAF4/0Jv6fjKsh08/s400/Picture+4.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5122481043269364466" /></a><h4>Setting up gcalcli on OS X</h4>Getting <b>gcalcli</b> working on OS X was a bit of a pain in the ass.  The first thing I recommend doing is making sure the <b>python</b> command in your PATH points to the latest version of Python.  For some reason <b>python</b> on my machine was version 2.4 and this caused me problems, so I installed the latest version of Python and did the following to make sure the <b>python</b> command used this version:<pre>sudo rm /usr/bin/python<br />sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python /usr/bin/python</pre>Once you have the latest version of Python, you need to get the GData Python module, ElementTree Python module, and dateutil Python module.  Links for all these are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gcalcli/" title="gcalcli - Google Code">here</a>.<br /><br />After installing all the pre-requisites, get <b>gcalcli</b> from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gcalcli/downloads/list" title="gcalcli - Google Code">the gcalcli project page on google code</a>.  I put <b>gcalcli</b> in <b>~/Documents/scripts/gcalcli</b>.  You'll also want to edit this file, entering your login information (email, password).<br /><br />A few other optional things I did to make using gcalcli easier were:<br /><h4>Add gcalcli to $PATH</h4>This allows you to call gcalcli no matter what directory you're currently working in in the terminal.  Add this line to your <b>~/.bash_profile</b>: <pre>export PATH="~/Documents/scripts/:$PATH"</pre><h4>Create an alias for gcalcli quick add</h4>Add this line to your <b>~/.bash_profile</b> if you want to be able to type <b>q '7:30 barber'</b> instead of <b>gcalcli quick '7:30 barber'</b>: <pre>alias q="~/Documents/scripts/gcalcli quick"</pre><br /><br />With all this stuff setup, creating a reminder for myself is super easy: I just hit <b>&#8984; Shift i</b> to open iTerm (see <a href="http://hackaddict.blogspot.com/search?q=trigger" title="hackaddict.net: Search results for trigger">Setup Global Keyboard Shortcuts to Open Any App with Quicksilver</a>), then type <b>q '9pm write blog post about gcal'</b> and I have captured the thought and can get it out of my mind and focus on whatever task is at hand.<h4>Enable SMS Quick Add to Google Calendar</h4>One final addition I just made to my Gcal setup is making SMS Quick Add events easy.  If you have Google Calendar setup with your mobile phone, you can text <b>9pm write blog post about gcal</b> to <b>48368</b> to quick add an event / reminder.  I added <b>48368</b> to my phonebook under "Google Calendar" to make adding reminders from my phone almost as easy as doing it from my computer.<br /><br /><br />The problem I've had with most reminder / todo software in the past is that it's too hard to enter tasks or reminders; hence, I'd always give up on using them and revert to pencil and paper.  My new Gcal setup makes capturing ideas super easy, so I think I'm gonna stick with it for a while.
