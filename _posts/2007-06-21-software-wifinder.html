<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5078504812952114946" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2007-06-21-image-0000.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;  width: 223px; height: 327px;"/>Today's software of the day is a little app called Wifind.<br/><br/>From their website:<br/><br/><strong>"Wireless Network Locator</strong><br/><p>WiFind shows you if wireless networks are locked or unlocked and their signal strength - <i>right in the airport menu</i>.  It's a tiny lightweight plugin for OS X that makes connecting to reliable wireless networks quicker and easier.  Whether you're at home, the office or at your favorite cafe - WiFind will help you locate a signal and start browsing!"</p>If you're on the move a lot, like I am, the $8 price tag is well worth it in saved time alone.  No longer do you have randomly click on networks until you hopefully find an open one.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.tastyapps.com/">Wifind can be downloaded here.</a>
