title: Faster Whois Lookups with Instant Domain Search
---

A friend of mine recently introduced me to a site called <a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Instant Domain Search</a>.  It's a little AJAX app that looks up domain name registration information very quickly.  I used to use the command line to do this:<br/><br/><code>% whois hackaddict.net</code><br/><br/>This method was a lot faster than going to any website to lookup registration info, but Instant Domain Search is even faster than the command line lookup.<br/><br/>Below is a widget they have on their website.  Give it a try.<br/><br/><iframe frameborder="0" id="ids-widget" name="ids-widget" scrolling="no" src="http://instantdomainsearch.com/widget/336x280/" style="width: 336px; height: 280px; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
