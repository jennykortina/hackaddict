title: 'Quick Tip: Convert Youtube Videos to MP3''s'
---

On one of my recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> binges I noticed a trend with many of the comments from the music videos I watched: they were requests for mp3 versions of the videos.<br /><br />I started thinking about possible solutions and realized that the <a href="http://hackaddict.blogspot.com/2007/02/quick-tip-download-videos-from-any.html">Zamzar video conversion plugin</a> for Firefox was just the remedy.<br /><br />After <a href="http://www.zamzar.com/tools/">installing the plugin,</a> conversion from video to mp3 is pretty simple:<br /><br />1. Load the video you want to make into an mp3 in Firefox.<br />2. Click the "Convert with Zamzar" button that has been newly installed into your bookmarks toolbar.<br />3.  You will be redirected to Zamzar's site where:<br /><ul><li>Step 1 has already been completed for you. </li><li>For step two, "Choose the format to convert to," select "mp3" from the drop down menu.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RkFOTQHh0bI/AAAAAAAAALM/tzM-wPKUx1U/s1600-h/ishot-4.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RkFOTQHh0bI/AAAAAAAAALM/tzM-wPKUx1U/s320/ishot-4.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5062413548792172978" border="0" /></a></li><li>Enter your email address into Step 3</li><li>Click convert for Step 4 and you're done!  Zamzar will convert the desired file for you and email it to the address you specified in step 3.<br /></li></ul>I tried this technique with the <span style="font-size:100%;"><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=pSIbfzK2spg&amp;related=">Imogen Heap - Just For Now (live at Studio 11 103.1FM)</a> video and it worked perfectly.  I hope this helps you guys.<br /></span>
