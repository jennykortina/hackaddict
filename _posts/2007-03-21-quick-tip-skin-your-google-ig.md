I like it because it loads pretty fast and uses my google login, which I pretty much always have open because I use Gmail and Google Docs.<br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5044441322290665954" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2007-03-21-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 392px; height: 256px;"/><br/>What do you use for your rss reader?
