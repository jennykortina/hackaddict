So after getting ready to go out today I realized that I had lost my passport.  The last memory I have of it was putting it somewhere it couldn't get lost...



I'd say 50% of the time when I put an object somewhere so I won't lose it, I end up losing it.  My safe place is so safe, I forget where it is.



I thought of a pretty good solution for this problem this evening.  I put my passport back where I found it and then I emailed emailed myself:



Subject: Passport

Message Body:  In your backpack in the closet.



I also copied my brother on the email and applied the label "Stuff."  This way when I lose my passport next time I can simply pull up my email and see where it is located.
