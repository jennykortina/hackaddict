While perusing <a href="http://www.digg.com">digg</a> the other day I happened upon one of those "Top 10 Essential OS X Aps" articles.  I usually know eight of the ten applications listed, stars like quick silver and transmission making regular appearances, but there is always at least one or two I haven't heard of and am willing to give a whirl.  This time a freeware app called Paparazzi! was the lucky winner.  <br /><br />The small but powerful application takes screen shots of websites.  When I first saw what it did I immediately thought: yeah but how often would you use such a feature?  Turns out after downloading and using it once, I use it a lot.  I was sold when I saw how it easy it was to use: simply put the url of the site you want to capture in the bar and click capture.  In no more than two seconds a screen shot of the url previously entered pops and then the image can either be saved or discarded.  Simple yet very very useful.  <br /><br />I have to admit that if I was not a blogger the program would be used rarely at best.  I find myself taking screen shots for the blog about three times a week and Paparazzi! does a phenomenal job.<br /><br />I give Paparazzi! four out of five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.derailer.org/paparazzi/">Get Paparazzi! here</a>
