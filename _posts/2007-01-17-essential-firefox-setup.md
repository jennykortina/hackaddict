title: Essential Firefox Setup (for web developers)
---

My iBook died a few days ago, so now I have a MacBook and just got it setup last night.  One of the first things I installed was <a href="http://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>.<br /><br />There are 2 main reasons I use Firefox instead of Safari.  The first is find-as-you-type search.  This means as you type what you're trying to find on a webpage, Firefox highlights matches as you type instead of waiting for you to press <b>Enter</b>.<br /><br />The second reason I use Firefox is that there are a few indispensable extensions for web development.  Here are all the details of my essential Firefox setup:<br /><h3>Essential preferences:</h3><br /><ol><br /><li>In preferences, set my homepage: <a href="http://google.com/ig">google ig</a> -- not great, but loads quickly</li><br /><li>In preferences, save downloads to <b>~/downloads</b> -- you need to create this directory if you want to do this</li><br /><li><b>* important * In preferences under security, set _Use a master password_ so your passwords are not stored in plain text</b></li><br /><li>setup <a href="http://del.icio.us">delicious</a>, a bookmarking tool that stores all your bookmarks on a web page you can access any time and organize using tags.  go <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/buttons">here</a> and get the delicious bookmarklet.  i like to rename the post bookmarklet to <b>del.save</b> and the my delicious to <b>del.view</b></li><br /><li>i also like to add an rss feed of what my friends are looking at and my own recent posts.  I name these <b>del.friends</b> and <b>del.save</b> respectively</li><br /><li>i also use a delicious tag <b>my_bb</b> to save a folder of bookmarks that are my favorites and that i want easy access to from my firefox bookmarks toolbar</li><br /></ol><br /><h3>Essential Extensions:</h3><br /><ol><br /><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/">firebug</a> for javascript debugging and DOM inspection</li><br /><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/">web developer</a> for live css editing and other useful development tools</li><br /><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1544/">backpack pages</a> for quick links to your backpack pages</li><br /><li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3616/">backpack publish</a> for quick posting to your backpack</li><br /></ol><br /><h3>Configuring Extensions:</h3><br /><ol><br /><li>add the backpack buttons to the toolbar (and remove the rest of the buttons if you don't like them)</li><br /><li>hide the web developer toolbar if you don't like it at the top</li><br /><li>enter the api keys for the backpack extensions</li><br /></ol>
