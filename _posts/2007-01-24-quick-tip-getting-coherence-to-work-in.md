title: 'Quick Tip:  Getting Coherence to Work in Parallels'
---

<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5023770269516586722" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2007-01-24-image-0000.gif" style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; "/><br/>After seeing a YouTube video of the new beta of <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> running in coherence mode I knew it was time to upgrade.  The lore of the ability to launch windows applications seemingly natively in OS X was just too powerful.<br/><br/>Upon installing <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> and getting a copy of XP running I was very excited to see coherence in action.  It looked simple enough, just click the coherence button and my computer would automatically morph into a windows application launcher.  However, life it not that simple and neither is parallels.   I would click the coherence button and nothing would happen.  After a couple hours of tinkering I finally found an option called "Install Parallels Tools" under the "Actions" menu.<br/><br/>After a quick Google search apparently it is crucial to install the Parallels tools feature for coherence to work properly.  Once the tools were installed and the system restarted I once again clicked the coherence button and to my shock and delight with the turn of the screen my start menu was now at the bottom of my OS X window.
