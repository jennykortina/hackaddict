I felt like Firefox hasn't been quite snappy enough lately, and I heard that Firefox 3 is mostly performance updates, so I decided to give the Beta a try.  ( <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">get Firefox 3 Beta 1 here</a> ).<br /><br />Although it was much faster, I could not live without my extensions, so I went back down to version 2.  Today, after a little searching, however, I found out how to force my extensions to work in the Beta.<br /><br />I managed to get my favorite extensions ( <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/" title="Firebug - Web Development Evolved">Firebug</a>, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-download/better-gmail-2-firefox-extension-for-new-gmail-320618.php" title="Exclusive Lifehacker Download: Better Gmail 2 Firefox Extension for New Gmail">Better Gmail 2</a>, <a href="http://snipfire.com/">Snipfire!</a>, and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2300">Autcomplete Manager</a>) working by following instructions from <a href="http://www.perfectblogger.com/2006/09/make-extensions-compatible-with-firefox2/">this post</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>What you can do is open the configuration (<span style="font-weight:bold;">about:config</span>) in your Firefox browser, right click the list and create a boolean <span style="font-weight:bold;">extensions.checkCompatibility</span> option there. Set its value to false and restart the browser.</blockquote><br /><br />Awesome!  Firefox 3 is SO fast!
