title: 'Quick Tip: Make iChat What it Should Be'
---

I have been using iChat for about a month.  Although it's a great program and has the ability to be used with most of the major chat interfaces I got frustrated with the lack of built in customizable features very quickly.  I never took the time to download a new client or find a way to add features to iChat itself, but the other day I was reading a forum that mentioned <a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax.</a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RfqZ3n-ugyI/AAAAAAAAAJo/ilZjMMvlm34/s1600-h/ishot-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RfqZ3n-ugyI/AAAAAAAAAJo/ilZjMMvlm34/s200/ishot-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5042511913698624290" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax</a> is a freeware application that puts iChat on steriods without the added rage.  The install is simple and clean adding a new tab in the preferences window of iChat entitled "Chax."<br /><br />The added features are very similar to ones found in more robust chat clients like Trillian for windows or Audium for OS X.   Some of the features I like are (<a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/features.php">the full list can be found here</a>):<br /><ul><li>Tabbed windows</li><li>Growl notifications<br /></li><li>Auto accept file transfers<br /></li><li>Auto accept text invitations</li><li>Auto away message</li></ul> Simply put, <a href="http://www.ksuther.com/chax/">Chax</a> adds features that iChat should have built in and is a must have for anyone who uses  iChat as your main chat client.<br /><br /><a href="http://www2.blogger.com/iChat%20as%20your%20main%20chat%20client">Chax can be downloaded here.</a>
