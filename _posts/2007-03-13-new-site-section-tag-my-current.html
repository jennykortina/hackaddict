I am constantly changing my desktop background because I use my computer so much I tire of my current ones quickly.  Since people have seemed to notice this, and they seem to like my backgrounds (as seen through the requests I've had for them) the plan is to post new backgrounds as I change them (this could be weekly or monthly depending on how quickly I bore of my current one).  I will also post where I found it.<br/><br/>So for the first ever post we have (which I found at a mac forum called <a href="http://www.macserialjunkie.com/">MSJ</a>):<br/><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5041269529983746738" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2007-03-13-image-0000.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/><br/><a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/221357-9d4">It can be downloaded here.</a><br/><br/>If you have a cool wallpaper that you would like to share please post a link to it in the comments section of any of the  "wallpaper" posts.
