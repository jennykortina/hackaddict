title: 'Quick Tip: Hack Your Myspace Friends Count'
---

I don't know if anyway uses myspace anymore, but I came across a pretty cool CSS trick the other day that I thought I'd post here.  



In his <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts" title="Mike Davidson: Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace">post on hacking myspace layouts</a>, Mike Davidson explains how to increase your friends count to the billions with the following CSS:

<b>

 .redbtext:after { content: " billion";}

</b>

I decided to do something similar:

<b>

 .redbtext:after {content: "997354"; }

</b>

Check out the result:

<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5076135325318039650" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2007-06-14-image-0000.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; "/>



(Aside: I never was a big fan of Myspace--maybe because I was on Facebook first--but there it seems that now are lots of slicker alternatives (virb, vox, etc.).  Anyone got suggestions for other cool social sites to check out?)
