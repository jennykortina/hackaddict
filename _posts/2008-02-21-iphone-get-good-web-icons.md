title: 'iPhone: Get good Web Icons'
---

Whenever my brother tried to create a web icon on his iPhone he would always get something that looked like a screen shot of the site (instead of the pretty polished icon that was specifically created for iPhones).  To ensure you are getting the icon that was created for iPhones make sure you wait a few seconds after you click the "Add to Home Screen" button to give the site time to load the icon (especially on edge).
