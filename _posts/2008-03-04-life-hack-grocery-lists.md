My brother and I both have iPhones and love the web application <a href="http://www.onetrip.org/">OneTrip (a mobile grocery list)</a>.



<a href="http://www.onetrip.org/">OneTrip: "What's the one thing you're sure to have on you when you go to the store - other than your wallet, that is? Your phone."</a><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5173924022715544306" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2008-03-04-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 237px; height: 202px;"/>



<a href="http://www.grocerylists.org/ultimatest/">For those of you without iPhones, or traditionalists, head over to Grocery Lists.org for "</a> <a href="http://www.grocerylists.org/ultimatest/">The Ultimatest Grocery List, a free downloadable PDF."</a>



It's pretty sweet, it's a downloaded pdf that you print and then check things off that you need.



So, hopefully now everyone can remember what they need at the grocery store, instead of getting home and realizing that you forgot the toilet paper!
