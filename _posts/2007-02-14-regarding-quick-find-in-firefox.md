title: Regarding the Quick Find in Firefox
---

Yesterday's <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/firefox/quick-firefox-tip-singlekey-search-tool-236156.php">Quick Firefox Tip: Single-key search tool</a> on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> ( a blog you should check out if you haven't already), there was a reminder / tip about using the slash ( / ) or apostrophe ( ' ) key to launch Quick Find to searcht the text of the current web page you're viewing in Firefox.



The post fails to mention the best thing about using <b>'</b> to launch Find instead of Ctrl-F. Using the apostrophe to search will search the text of all the links on a page, and highlight each link with a dotted line as it matches that link.  This allows you to follow the link by hitting <b>Enter</b> and is a great way to avoid using the mouse for all of you who love keyboard navigation.  Try it out next time you need to change cities on <a href="http://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>.
