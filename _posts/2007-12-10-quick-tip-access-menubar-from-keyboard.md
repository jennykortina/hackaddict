title: 'Quick Tip:  Access the Menubar from the Keyboard in OS X'

Something I just learned, but have wanted to know for so long:



<blockquote>you can access the menubar from keyboard by pressing CTRL + F2.</blockquote> via a comment on

Make sure full-keyboard access is turned on in order for this to work.  From another comment on the same post: <blockquote>the 'Full Keyboard Access' option in the System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &amp; Mouse screen. If you open up your prefs and go to the Keyboard &amp; Mouse Prefs, then click “Keyboard” tab. Than set the full keyboard access to “All Controls” This gives you tab control in dialogs.</blockquote>
