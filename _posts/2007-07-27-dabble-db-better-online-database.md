title: 'Dabble DB: A Better Online Database Solution'
---

I recently needed to build a database to track some information. My brother suggested I use Dabble DB, an online database solution. Dabble is free to use as long as you make your databases public data, but if you prefer for a small fee you can keep your data private.

"Dabble DB lets you build database applications with no hassle. Itâ€™s <strong>easy to use</strong> yet extremely <strong>flexible and powerful</strong>.</p>Unlike a spreadsheet, you can <strong>save multiple views</strong> of your data from any angle and <strong>re-organize</strong> it on a whim. And you can <strong>share everything with colleagues</strong>."
