title: 'MicroTip:  Run Quicktime Full Screen on a Secondary Display'
---

I have a 32' Westinghouse HDTV sitting right next to my computer which I often hook up to use as a secondary or an external display.  Up until now I had no idea how to make Quicktime full screen on it while using it as a secondary display.<br/><br/>Make Quicktime full screen while on a secondary display:<br/>1.  Hook up external display<br/>2.  Launch Quicktime Pro and open the preferences section<br/>3.  In the "Full Screen" tab simply drag the Quicktime logo to the screen you want to be able to do full screen on.<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5038603351796837826" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2007-03-06-image-0000.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/>
