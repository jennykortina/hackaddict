title: Clean Up Your iTunes Music Library in OS X - Script to Delete Missing Files
---

Yesterday, I wasn't getting frustrated because a bunch of the songs in my iTunes Music Library were broken links to songs on an external hard drive that I know longer use.  My fix was to remove all the songs from my Library in iTunes, then to just add my whole music folder back to the iTunes Library.



Had I waited a day, I could have used this nice little script published by Mac OS X Hints: <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2007031309145927" title="Clear out missing files in iTunes">Clear out missing files in iTunes Script</a>.
