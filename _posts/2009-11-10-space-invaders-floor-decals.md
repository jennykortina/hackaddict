It pays to have friends with vinyl cutters...




My boss has a sweet donkey kong 8 bit graphic on her door to her office. I've always admired it so one day I asked her where she got it. She pointed me to <a href="http://www.whatisblik.com/">blik</a>. After perusing their inventory I finally landed on the idea of putting space invaders on the floor of my apartment, but quickly realized that the stickers on blik would not hold up to the wear and tear that a floor would get.





In come my friends over at <a href="http://labs.laan.com/">Laan Labs</a>. They have a vinyl cutter....after a quick Google search I located the <a href="http://www.classicgaming.cc/classicS/spaceinvaders/graphics.php">vector graphics</a> I needed, emailed them to my friends, and they cut my decals. I was ready to roll within a matter of days.
