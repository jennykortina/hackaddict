I have been working on my taxes like crazy, but today a few kinks came up that are going to make it impossible for me to file on time.  Luckily, I found how to e-file for extensions for both Federal and New York State income taxes.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.taxbrain.com/taxcenter/extensions/fed.asp">http://www.taxbrain.com/taxcenter/extensions/fed.asp</a><br /><blockquote>Make your credit card payment to the IRS at the <a href="http://www.pay1040.com/taxbrain">PAY1040.com</a> web site. Making your payment in this way automatically qualifies you for an extension of time to file your tax return until October 15, 2008. You will not need to file any other forms at this time.</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.taxbrain.com/taxcenter/extensions/NY.asp">http://www.taxbrain.com/taxcenter/extensions/NY.asp</a><br /><blockquote>New York accepts payment by credit card through <a href="http://www.officialpayments.com/taxbrain.jsp">Official Payments Corporation</a>. Making your payment in this way automatically qualifies you for an extension of time to file your tax return until October 15, 2008. You will not need to file any other forms at this time.</blockquote>
