title: How To Easily Find Recently Downloaded Files in OS X
---

I have Firefox set to save my downloaded files to my home directory in a folder called <b>downloads</b>, but often times, for whatever reason, my downloads end up on my Desktop or in some other folder in my home directory.  And I have no idea where my <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/" title="Adium - Download">Adium</a> and torrent downloads are set to save.  In any case, I found it useful to create a <b>Recent Downloads</b> Smart Folder, because I always have a hard time finding the file I just downloaded.  Here's how to do it:<br/><br/>Open a <b>Finder</b> window and hit <b>âŒ˜ f</b>.  In the top grey bar, where it says <b>Servers Computer Home Others...</b> click <b>Others...</b>.<br/><br/>Check any folders where your recent downloads might end up.  If you don't see one of the folders there, hit the <b>+</b> in the bottom left of this window to add it.  Hit <b>OK</b> when you've added all the folders you want to include in the search.<br/><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5090762085572944530" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2007-07-24-image-0000.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; "/><br/><br/>In the first search criteria selector, choose <b>Created</b> in the first dropdown and <b>Today</b> in the second dropdown.  You can optionally add as many other criteria as you want, but I just used that one.<br/><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5090761948133991042" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/posts/2007-07-24-image-0001.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; "/><br/><br/>When you've selected all the criteria for your search, hit <b>Save</b> in the top right, and choose to add the smart folder to your sidebar.
