I'll admit it, I'm addicted to Twitter.    The only thing that I have found that I don't like about Twitter is the inability to receive updates, either via email or SMS, for all of your @replies; I fix things I don't like.<br/><br/>I've used a combination of Yahoo pipes and a free service, <a href="http://notify.me/">notify.me</a>, to receive all of my @replies via SMS.      A few notes about my method:<br/><ul><li>You can configure your updates to come as any combination of the following: SMS, email or IM.   This tutorial focuses on SMS.<br/></li><li>Since we're using Yahoo pipes to create the RSS feed of all the @replies there is a bit of lag between the actual Twitter @ reply and the notification.</li><li>The Yahoo pipe that we are using catches all @replies, not just ones that start with @reply ie: "great link from <a href="http://twitter.com/jennykortina">@jennykortina</a>"<br/></li></ul><br/>To receive all of your Twitter @replies via SMS:<ol><li>Head over to this <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/geekygirldawn/ea0f9c9d6e951617143d4def230d4d3b">Yahoo Pipe</a></li><li>Enter your Twitter username in the field and click the "Run Pipe" button<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299515104605404418" src="/assets/images/2009-02-05-image-0000.png" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 320px; height: 138px;"/></li><li>After the pipe is done running, click the "Get as RSS" button<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299515308084629202" src="/assets/images/2009-02-05-image-0001.png" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 320px; height: 136px;"/></li><li>A new window will be loaded with your RSS feed.  Copy the RSS link from the navigation bar</li><li>Head over to <a href="http://notify.me/">notify.me</a> and register for a new account</li><li>Configure each notification method that you would like to use: SMS, Email, and IM</li><li>Click the "Sources" tab</li><li>Paste your Yahoo Pipe RSS feed from step 4 into feed box and click the "Add Feed" button<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299515795593475074" src="/assets/images/2009-02-05-image-0002.png" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 320px; height: 113px;"/></li><li>The field will appear in the blue box below the "Add Feed" section.  Click on the buttons for the type of notifications you would like to receive.  In my case, I only have SMS selected.<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5299516162125841410" src="/assets/images/2009-02-05-image-0003.png" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 320px; height: 169px;"/></li></ol><br/>You now will get all of your Twitter @ replies as SMS messages to your phone.  Like I said earlier, there is a slight delay between the time the actual @ reply message is posted and when you get the SMS, but it's worth the wait!<a href="http://twitter.com/jennykortina"><br/></a>
