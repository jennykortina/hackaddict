This is a fairly technical one, but for anyone that's done<br/><pre>sudo lookupd --flushcache</pre><br/>in versions of OS X before Leopard, you may have noticed that it doesn't work in Leopard.<br/><br/>The new way to clear your hosts cache is<br/><pre>sudo dscacheutil -flushcache</pre><br/><br/>This is useful if you happen to be messing with the <b>/etc/hosts</b> file.
