So for work I had to make a PowerPoint presentation with video clips in it.  Doesn't sound too hard right?  I didn't think so easier.  I was just going to use Snapz to record video clips and then insert those clips right into PowerPoint (Snapz will be reviewed next week for those of you who don't know what it is).  This method worked great until I tried to play the PowerPoint with it's videos on a windows computer (Which I tried for the first time in front of a sales seminar - quick tip: don't try things for the first time in front of a audience).<br/><br/>Alright, now down to the nitty gritty.  The easiest way to do convert an mov to an mpeg on a mac is to open the mov in quicktime pro and export it as mp4.  Once the mp4 is encoded go to <a href="http://www.zamzar.com/">Zamzar</a>.  Upload the mp4 and choose to encode it as an mpeg.  It will take a few minutes and when it's done it will send a link to the file to the email you specified.
