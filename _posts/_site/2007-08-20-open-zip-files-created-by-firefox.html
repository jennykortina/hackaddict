I'm working on a few Firefox extensions, and I came across a pretty slick tool that generates a skeleton for your extension:<br/><br/><a href="http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensionwiz/" title="Firefox/Thunderbird Extension Wizard">Firefox / Thunderbird Extension Generator</a><br/><br/>You put in some basic info about your extension and it generates a zip file with the skeleton for your extension.  For some reason, whenever I double-clicked this zip in OS X and Stuff-it tried to expand the zip, I got this error:<br/><br/><b>An error occurred attempting to expand 'extension.zip'.  Format error.  Error #17540.</b><br/><br/>After about 15 minutes of frustrating attempts to rebuild the extension all resulting in the same error, I just tried opening the file from the command line:<br/><br/><pre>$ cd downloads</pre><br/><pre>$ unzip extension.zip</pre><br/><br/>This did the trick.
