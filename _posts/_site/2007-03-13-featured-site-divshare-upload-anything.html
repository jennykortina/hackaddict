In comes DivShare.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.divshare.com/">DivShare</a> is a <strong>free file hosting service</strong> for everyone. No registration required!<br/><ul class="checks"><li>Upload  <strong>unlimited</strong> files</li><li>Serve  <strong>unlimited</strong> downloads</li><li>Files <strong>stay online forever!</strong></li><li>No pop-up ads or spam</li><li>Incredibly fast, reliable servers</li></ul>I signed up for an account last night and so far it looks pretty awesome.

So far it's a great file sharing solution.<br/><br/>Below is a quick screenshot I took of the interface once you are logged in (dashboard view):<br/><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5041391073263256274" src="/assets/images/2007-03-13-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/>
