Something I just learned, but have wanted to know for so long:<br/><br/><blockquote>you can access the menubar from keyboard by pressing CTRL + F2.</blockquote> via a comment on<br/><a href="http://iboughtamac.com/2007/01/13/useful-keyboard-shortcuts-in-os-x/">this post</a>.<br/><br/><br/>Make sure full-keyboard access is turned on in order for this to work.  From another comment on the same post: <blockquote>the 'Full Keyboard Access' option in the System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &amp; Mouse screen. If you open up your prefs and go to the Keyboard &amp; Mouse Prefs, then click “Keyboard” tab. Than set the full keyboard access to “All Controls” This gives you tab control in dialogs.</blockquote>
