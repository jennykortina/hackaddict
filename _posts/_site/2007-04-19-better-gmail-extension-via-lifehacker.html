Yesterday I downloaded the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/lifehacker-code-better-gmail-firefox-extension-251923.php">Better Gmail Firefox Extension from Lifehacker</a> and I have to say, it's sweet.<br/><br/>So far, my favorite features are the additional Keyboard Shortcuts.  Before I used the built in shortcuts for next <b>j</b>, previous <b>k</b>, select <b>x</b>, and compose <b>c</b>.<br/><br/>Now, I can label things with <b>l</b>, trash things with <b>t</b>, and read/archive with <b>d</b>.<br/><br/>I haven't delved much into the other features like "Saved Searches" yet, but this extension is easily on track to becoming my favorite (after <a href="http://getfirebug.com">firebug</a>).
