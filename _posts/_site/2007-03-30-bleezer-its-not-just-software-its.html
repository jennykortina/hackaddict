Setup was breeze, all I did was enter my blogger user id and password, and the interface is clean and easy to use.  I am very interested to see how the pinging service works and am excited that I finally have a way to blog offline.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.larryborsato.com/bleezer/">Bleezer can be downloaded for any os here.</a>
