This is pretty hilarious:<br/><a href="http://www.twit.tv/104">Twit 104</a>.  Scott Jordan of SeV investigated the company that provides the "Hacker Safe" images you see on a lot of websites and found out that they didn't really do much other than give you a sticker that made your customers feel safe (think placebo effect).<br/><br/>So he made his own image with "Hacker Proof" on it and they ended up suing him.<br/><br/>Both phrases are pretty funny, and props to Scott for coming up with such a great spoof.  Also, funny how context matters: places like <a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker</a> and hackaddict treat hacker endearingly, but to most people it's a warning flag.<br/><br/>Check out the podcast.  Worth a listen.
