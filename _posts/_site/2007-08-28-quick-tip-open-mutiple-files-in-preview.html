Unfortunately, when you click on one picture that is in the same folder as the rest of the pictures, Preview doesn't automatically recognize the photo is a part of a set and let you scroll through them all at once (you have to open each one individually).<br/><br/>To open photos as a set in preview all you have to do is:<ol><li>Highlight all of them (click the first picture in the set and while holding shift click the last photo in the set)</li><li>Right click on them (crtl+click)</li><li>Chose "Open with" &gt; Preview<br/></li></ol><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5103819688534450722" src="/assets/images/2007-08-28-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/>
