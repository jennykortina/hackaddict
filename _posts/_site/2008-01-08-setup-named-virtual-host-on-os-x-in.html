Today, in order to make some testing easier, I wanted to setup a named virtual host in Apache.  Here's how I did it.<br/><br/>In terminal,<br/><pre>mate /etc/hosts # open hosts file in textmate</pre><br/><br/>Add this line:<br/><br/><pre>127.0.0.1 www.layersix.dev</pre><br/><br/>This tells your browser (or whatever) to look on your personal webserver for any requests to www.layersix.dev.  In terminal, do<br/><pre>lookupd -flushcache</pre><br/>to make sure you clear your cache of dns names.<br/><br/>In terminal,<br/><pre>mate /etc/httpd/httpd.conf</pre><br/><br/>This is the apache settings file.  Look for "NameVirtualHost" and make sure the line reads<br/><br/><pre>NameVirtualHost *:80</pre><br/><br/>Make sure there is no <b>#</b> before this.<br/><br/>Add the following:<br/><pre><br/><virtualhost *:80=""><br/> DocumentRoot /Library/WebServer/Documents/layersix.dev<br/> ServerName www.layersix.dev<br/></virtualhost><br/></pre><br/><br/>Go to <b>/Library/WebServer/Documents/</b> and make a folder called layersix.dev (or whatever). Make a file called <b>index.html</b> and put some text in it.  I did <b>echo 'hi' &gt; layersix.dev/index.html</b>.  Restart your webserver in <b>System Preferences &gt; Sharing</b>.  Go to www.layersix.dev in Firefox or whatever browser you use.  You should now see your index.html file.<br/><br/>This post was helpful in figuring this out:<br/><a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20010423075959611">http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20010423075959611</a>
