In fact, it's at the point where I decided that I needed a home a media server because my external hard drive was just not cutting it anymore.  I decided to build a Linux box running Xubuntu because of the versatility and stability Linux provides, and I found <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/06/05/build_your_own_server/1">a how to article</a> a few weeks back on Digg which outlined the entire process.<br/><br/>After the server was up and running I decided that I wanted my computer to auto-mount my Samba drive whenever I was at home.   Using a combination of an AppleScript saved as an application and a free software for OS X, <a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">Home Zone</a>, I was able to have my computer identify when I'm at home and only launch my Samba drive when I'm here.<br/><br/>Let's get started:<br/><br/>The first thing I did was searched Google and <a href="http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-16189.html">found an AppleScript</a> to mount my Samba drive.  <a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/886266-ce9">It can be downloaded as a .txt here</a> (I can't paste it into blogger b/c of errors).<br/><br/>After I replaced the server information with my own I saved the script as an application and dropped it into my applications folder.  If I had a desktop I could just launch the script every time I booted my computer (system preferences -&gt; accounts -&gt; login items), but since I have a laptop I only wanted the drive to mount when I was at home where the drive is.<br/><br/>There are several free location automators for OS X and after trying a few I decided to use <a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">Home Zone</a> because it was the easiest to configure:<ol><li>Install and launch Home Zone</li><li>Click on the Home Zone icon in your menu bar and select "Configure"</li><li>In the "Zones" section click the plus arrow and name your new zone (Home in my case).</li><li>In the "Triggers" section click the plus arrow and select the following options:</li><ul><li>When "all" of the following are available</li><li>Kind: "Airport Network"</li><li>Network: "Your wireless Network Name"</li><li>Check the "Only when connected" box</li></ul><li>In the "Actions - Entering the Zone" section click the plus arrow.  Use the following configuration:<br/></li><ul><li>Action: Open File</li><li>Drag the Samba mounting AppleScript into the space right below the action pull down menu (it should say "Drag any file here")<br/><br/><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5074058409404225250" src="/assets/images/2007-06-09-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; "/></li></ul></ol>That's it...you're done!  Now anytime you are on your home network your samba drive will automount.<br/><workgroup><user><pwd><server></server></pwd></user></workgroup>
