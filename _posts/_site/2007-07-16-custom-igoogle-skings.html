Feedback welcome of course - I hope you like!"<br/><br/>And like it I do!  I've been wanting to customize my iGoogle skin since the very fist day I used it.  I haven't had time to create my own yet, but the included custom ones are pretty neat and the instructions are pretty clear on how to go about doing it.  I can't wait to start designing.  Thanks Greg!
