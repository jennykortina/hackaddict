With the release of iOS 5.0 for iPhones and iPads it's now possible to set a custom sound for emails (among other items).  I thought it'd be fun to use the old school <a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/15932259-94a">"you've got mail" sound byte</a> for my emails.  To set a custom tone for your incoming mail make sure your iPhone/iPad has iOS 5.0 then:<div><br/></div><div>1. On you iOS device click Settings&gt;Sounds</div><div>2. Scroll down to the new mail option.  After you click on it you can see you can load any of your custom ringtones.  <a href="http://hackaddict.blogspot.com/2007/11/free-custom-iphone-ringtones-using-only.html">(Here's an article on how to make custom ringtones).</a></div>
