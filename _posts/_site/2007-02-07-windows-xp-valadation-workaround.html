The cuz and I were reformatting an old computer for a friend of ours tonight and when we went to validate the windows xp key it said it was maxed out.  When we called Microsoft and told them our error  they simply gave us a validation key.  The whole phone call only took five minutes and we're now up and running.  I'm not sure if we lucked out or if people are too afraid to call and ask, but it appears that you can buy one copy of windows and keep using it even if your validations are maxed out.<br/><br/>Please leave comments and personal stories.
