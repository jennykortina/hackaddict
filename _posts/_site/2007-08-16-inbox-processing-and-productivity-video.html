I recently came across <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925&amp;hl=en">this video</a> about processing your email inbox quickly and efficiently.  It's a talk that Merlin Man (from <a href="http://43folders.com">43 folders</a>) gave at google and it contains some pretty useful tips about productivity in general, including a lot of GTD related stuff.  It's definitely worth checking out.<br/><br/><embed flashvars="" id="VideoPlayback" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=973149761529535925&amp;hl=en" style="width:400px; height:326px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"/>
