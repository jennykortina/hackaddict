title: 'Quick Tip:  Email Large Files'
---

My job often involves emailing large files ie artwork, pictures which would not be a problem if everyone used gmail; however, I often get files bounced back  because they are too large for the recipient to accept.



My first solution was FTP, but my brother said that makes your website less secure so he suggested <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Dropsend</a>.  Dropsend was a great utitlity; however, if you wanted to send more than 5 files you have to sign up and pay monthly fees.  I then did a quick Google search for viable alternatives and came up with <a href="http://www.youswap.com">Youswap</a>.  Youswap is a completely free service that lets you email as many files as you would like.

***YouSwap is currently in beta so you can only send files right now unless you get accepted into the beta invite.***
