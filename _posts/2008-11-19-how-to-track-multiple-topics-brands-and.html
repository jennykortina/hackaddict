Tracking conversations about people, brands, ideas, topics, or any area of interest really, is a new part of my daily routine now that I can track all of these things in real time with using <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.<br/><br/>Over the weekend, I found myself hopping back and forth between several browser tabs doing Twitter searches for things like <a href="http://bit.ly/RR7J" title="tracking conversations on twitter">"bitly," "quantum of solace," and "bbq nyc"</a>. Usually I monitor this sort of thing in <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/">Tweetdeck</a>, but I was on a friend's laptop and didn't want to download the app. So I started writing some javascript, and ended up with a pretty cool tool called <a href="http://www.convomonitor.com/" title="Convo Monitor: Twitter conversations tracker and dashboard">Convo Monitor</a>.<br/><br/>Convo Monitor is a simple Twitter dashboard that allows you to view up to 10 searches on a single page. I wanted to keep things lightweight, so there's no signup / account creation necessary.  To save your Convo Monitor, you bookmark a link to the dashboard you created and load it up next time you want to check the Twitter conversations you're tracking.<br/><br/>One of the cool things Convo Monitor can do because there are no accounts and everything is saved as part of the URL is dashboard sharing.  If you make a dashboard of topics you think a friend or colleague may be interested in, you can just grab a bookmark to that page and Email or IM it to them.<br/><br/>I whipped up a quick screencast demo-ing some of the features of Convo Monitor. Here it is:<br/><br/><object height="350" width="425"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/74n47148x2Q"/> <embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/74n47148x2Q" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"/> </object><br/><br/>Setting up a dashboard tracking the topics I frequently check has saved me lots of time and Convo Monitor has become part of my routine. Post some dashboards to the comments if you come up with interesting ones.<br/><br/>Check out the app at <a href="http://www.convomonitor.com/" title="Convo Monitor: Twitter Conversations Tracker">www.convomonitor.com</a>
