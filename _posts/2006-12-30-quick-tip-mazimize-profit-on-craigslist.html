I sell a lot of stuff on Craigslist and have learned a few things that make sales go faster and less painful.  Here are some things I've learned along the way:<br /><ol><li>Know your product and price it accordingly.  You must know your market and know how much your product is worth and can fetch. <br /></li><li>Always, always post pictures of what you are selling.  Posting pictures lets the buyer see the basic condition of the item and it also creates credibility.</li><li>List your phone number.  Listing your number lets buyers know you are real and serious about making a deal. (If you don't want to use your number use an auto expiring one from <a href="http://www.craigsnumber.com/">Craigsnumber</a>).</li><li>Use astricks like bullets to separate lines on your entries.</li><li>Say "If you are reading this the item is still available."  Many times people think the item is gone and do not bother emailing or calling.</li><li>If at all possible, list "Can meet same day."  Once again it shows you are serious about making a deal and adds credibility.</li><li>OBO - or best offer.  If you are desperate to sell something, list it a little higher than what you want for it and put OBO at the end of the post.</li><li>Be as specific as possible and be honest.</li><li>Emphasize the good qualities of your product.  What sets your weight bench apart from the thirty others?  Include extras when possible (Install software on computers, through in a carrying case for a laptop, etc.)</li><li>If you are selling something that is customized, write "UPGRADED" next to the feature you added or paid extra for.</li></ol>
