When I have a large photo set I would like to look at in OS X the quickest and easiest way is to open them with preview.  Unfortunately, when you click on one picture that is in the same folder as the rest of the pictures, Preview doesn't automatically recognize the photo is a part of a set and let you scroll through them all at once (you have to open each one individually).



To open photos as a set in preview all you have to do is:<ol> 
<li>Highlight all of them (click the first picture in the set and while holding shift click the last photo in the set) </li>
 
<li>Right click on them (crtl+click) </li>
 
<li>Chose "Open with" &gt; Preview

 </li>
