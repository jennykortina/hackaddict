Unfortunately, when you click on one picture that is in the same folder as the rest of the pictures, Preview doesn't automatically recognize the photo is a part of a set and let you scroll through them all at once (you have to open each one individually).<br /><br />To open photos as a set in preview all you have to do is:<ol><li>Highlight all of them (click the first picture in the set and while holding shift click the last photo in the set)</li><li>Right click on them (crtl+click)</li><li>Chose "Open with" > Preview<br /></li></ol><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RtRo9yy9oiI/AAAAAAAAARg/XGZRhHyfVKo/s1600-h/ishot-2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RtRo9yy9oiI/AAAAAAAAARg/XGZRhHyfVKo/s320/ishot-2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5103819688534450722" border="0" /></a>
