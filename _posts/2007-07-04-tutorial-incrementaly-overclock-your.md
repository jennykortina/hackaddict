Incremental overclocking can be a HUGE app booster as a well a HUGE battery saver.  When your phone isn't busy it clocks itselft down way lower than it's normal speed, and when it needs it a cpu boost is delivered to get those applications loaded a bit quicker.<br/><br/>To overclock your windows mobile phone you need:<br/><br/>*<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=255771">omap overclocker</a><br/>*<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=270751">batterystatus plus</a> - <a href="http://www.chi-tai.info/cs_BatteryStatus_XDA_Neo_WM5_iM_cs.htm#Donate">this guy is badass, click here to donate to him</a><br/>*i have no idea which phones are supported, please list phones that you try in the comments<br/><a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/1140259-aef"><br/>Here is a zip of both.</a><a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/1140259-aef"><br/></a><br/>Omap clocker:<br/>Drag the .exe somewhere onto your phone (I put mine in the \windows\program files).  That's it!<br/><br/>Configuring batterstatus plus:<br/><ol><li>Settings&gt;Today&gt;BatteryStatus - click options on the right hand side</li><li>Go to the Omap tab and make sure "overclock to speed" is checked.  I also check "overlcok on wakeup" and "overclock after reboot"</li><li>go to the cpu scaler tab. <br/></li><ol><li>Min=81mhz</li><li>Org=195mhz</li><li>Max=221mhz (can safely go up to 231 but i keep it there to conserve batteries)</li><li>Boost=234mhz (can safely go up to 286 but i keep it there to conserve batteries)</li></ol></ol>I highly recommend installing batter Status Plus even if you can't overclock your phone b/c it has a lot of other great options.
