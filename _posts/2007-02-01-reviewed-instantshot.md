InstantShot! is a killer OS X freeware application that takes screen shots.  You might be thinking, why would you download a separate program when OS X already has a built in application to perform this very function?  Well, to put it bluntly the built in program that OS X has, Grab, sucks.<br /><br />InstantShot! is able to take: screen shots, shots within in a rectangle, shots with a timer, and shots in a series.  With each shot you are also able to choose between saving it as a: jpeg, png, or tiff.  Another great feature is that InstantShot! has a finder icon, so whenever you need a screen shot taking one is a simple as clicking on the InstantShot! icon in your finder bar, selecting what type of shot you want, and the way you want to save your shot.<br /><br />Here is a quick snapshot I took with it to show the menu structure:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RcKMIDx10XI/AAAAAAAAAEc/WE75iSd9MPw/s1600-h/hackaddict.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RcKMIDx10XI/AAAAAAAAAEc/WE75iSd9MPw/s320/hackaddict.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5026734204180091250" border="0" /></a><br />InstantShot! receives a perfect 5 out of 5<br /><br /><a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/31545">Get InsantShot! here</a>
