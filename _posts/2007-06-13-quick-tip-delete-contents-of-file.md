I had to clear out some log files on one of the iminlikewithyou servers yesterday, but I didn't want to delete and recreate the files because I thought that might screw up permissions.  I'd been meaning to learn how to zero out a file to empty contents for a while, so I took this opportunity to figure it out.<br /><br />Do all this from the command line or terminal.<br /><br />This will create a new file named t whose contents is the word "test":<br /><b>$ echo "test" > t</b><br /><br /><b>more</b> will display the contents of the file:<br /><b>$ more t</b><br /><b>test</b><br /><br />Here's the new trick I learned.  <b>cat</b> reads the contents of <b>/dev/null</b> (which contains nothing) and <b>&gt;</b> writes this into <b>t</b><br /><b>$ cat /dev/null > t</b><br /><br />Now <b>t</b> contains nothing:<br /><b>$ more t</b><br /><br />Get rid of it (don't do this to your logfile)<br /><b>$ rm t</b>
