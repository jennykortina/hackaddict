One thing I have always wanted to do is be able to sync my iPhone or iPod with any computer.  Lifehacker had an article "<a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/ipod/hack-attack-add-music-and-movies-to-your-ipod-from-any-computer-without-itunes-237986.php">Hack Attack: Add music and movies to your iPod from any computer without iTunes</a>" a while back, but the software they used does not support iPhones or iPod Touches.  I have developed a method to connect any iPod or iPhone to any computer to download the music or movies from that comptuer to the iPod or iPhone.  Once configured, you only need your iPhone or Ipod, the USB sync cable, and a computer with iTunes to impliment the hack (the idea being you always have your iPhone or iPod and the person with the computer has the iPod USB cable).  It takes about 20 minutes to set this hack up and then only a few seconds to implement each time you would like to use it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Things to Note:</span><br /><ul><li>If you want to be able to do this hack on both Macs and Windows machines, you're going to have to configure two seperate iTunes libraries: one from a Mac and one from a Windows machine.</li><li>I was using an iPhone when writing this tutorial, so the iPod directions may need some clarification.</li><li>If you are using an iPhone or iPod touch: When you sync your device, the account last used to access the iTunes Store from the computer is synced to the mobile device. So make sure you sign out of your friend's iTunes account before you sync your deviece, otherwise when you try to download application via the app store on your phone you will be logged in as them.<br /></li><li>Does not work with DRM'ed music<br /></li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">What You'll Need:</span><ul><li>Computer with iTunes<br /></li><li>iPhone: wifi, usb cable, iTunes, phone</li><li>iPod: cable, iTunes, ipod</li><li>Software: <a href="http://tuppis.com/smultron/"><br /></a><ul><li>Mac: <a href="http://tuppis.com/smultron/">Smultron</a>, <a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/">Hex Feind</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ipoddisk/">IpodDisk</a> (Open Source Free Software for Macs)</li><li>Windows: <a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/%7Eprewett/hexedit/">Hex Edit</a>, <a href="http://www.podtopc.com/downloads.html">Pod to PC</a><br /></li></ul></li></ul><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure your iPhone or iPod to use as External Storage:</span><br /><br />You are only going to have to configure your iPhone or iPod to be used an external storage once.<br /><ol><li>Setup iPhone or iPod to use as storage device:<br /><ul><li>iPhone: Download &amp; Configure Airshare</li><li>iPod: Setup as hard drive<br /><ol><li>Connect iPod to computer<br /></li><li>iTunes>Prefences>iPod Tab<br /></li><li>Click checkbox "Enable disk use"</li><li>Close iTunes</li></ol></li></ul></li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manually Manage Music and Videos on iPhone or iPod:</span><br /><br />We need to make it so we can simply drag songs onto our iPhone or iPod.<br /><ol><li>Launch iTunes</li><li>Connect iPhone or iPod<br /></li><li>Select the "Manually manage my iPhone or iPod" option</li><li>Close iTunes<br /></li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating an iTunes Index on your iPhone or iPod:</span><br /><br />If you want to be able to get sync with both Macintosh and Windows computers you are going to have to make two separate iTunes index folders: one for Macs and one for Windows boxes.<br /><ol><li>Mount iPhone or iPod as external storage device.</li><li>Point the iTunes index to your iPhone or iPod.<br /><ul><li>On a mac: while holding "option," double click on your iTunes icon.<br /></li><li>On a windows machine: while holding "Shift," double click on your iTunes icon in your start menu.  </li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">If you want to sync on both Macintosh and Windows machines you have to do this step on a Macintosh and Windows box</span><br /></li></ul>   </li><li>A “Choose your library” window will pop up.

We need to edit the the files on your iPhone or iPod so that whatever computer you connect your device to thinks it can sync to your iPhone or iPod.  <a href="http://www.andrewgrant.org/2008/03/30/how-to-sync-an-iphone-with-two-or-more-computers.html">I found this tutorial over at the Shiny Things blog.</a>  Thanks Andrew!<br /><ol><li>On your computer navigate to your iTunes music folder: <ul><li>Macs: User>Music>iTunes</li><li>Windows: Music>iTunes<br /></li></ul></li><li>Right click on "iTunes Music Library.xml" and it with a text editor (<a href="http://tuppis.com/smultron/">Smultron</a> in OS X and Notepad in Windows)<br /></li><li>Look for the "Library Persistent ID" <string></string></li><li>There will be a sting of numbers and letters between the "string" tags.  In the screenshot below it is: 8B6C633F7DACB74B. Copy this entry to your to another document for safe keeping.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/SZVQw72eW9I/AAAAAAAAAls/RIAkxF1_9JE/s1600-h/sync-notepad.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 199px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/SZVQw72eW9I/AAAAAAAAAls/RIAkxF1_9JE/s320/sync-notepad.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5302232937928743890" border="0" /></a></li><li>It's time to edit the files on your iPhone or iPod.  Go ahead and mount your iPhone or iPod and then navigate to the iTunes folder we created earlier.</li><li>Find the "iTunes Music Library.xml," and open it with a text editor.<br /></li><li>Look for the "Library Persistent ID." First, copy whatever is between "string" tags to a text document for safe keeping.  Next, Replace whatever is between the "string" tags <string>with our key that we copied earlier.  In our example we are replacing the ID on the iPhone or iPod with: </string>8B6C633F7DACB74B</li><li>Save the file and close it.</li><li>Now find the tile called "iTunes Music Library" and open it with a Hexeditor. (On a Windows machine is called "iTunes Music Library.itl")</li><li>Select "Find and Replace" from the Edit menu. Make sure "Hex" matching is selected (not ASCII). In "Find" enter the ID from the iPhone or iPod before we replaced it (The ID we put into a text document in step 7). In Replace, enter the ID we copied from the original computer (in our example it's 8B6C633F7DACB74B). Choose Replace All, there should be one match.</li><li>Save the file.  Close the hexeditor.</li><li>We are now completely done configuring the iPhone or iPod.  If you want to be able to sync to both Windows and Mac machinces, make sure the do the all the steps listed above on both Windows and Mac machines.<br /></li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Music from Other Computers (Finally!):</span><br /><br />Getting  music from computers that are not your home computer is the step that you will have to perform over and over again.<br /><ol><li>Mount your iPhone (using Airshare) or iPod (as an external storage device)</li><li>Point the computer's iTunes index to the one on your iPhone or iPod:<br /><ul><li>On a Mac: while holding "option," double click on your iTunes icon.<br /></li><li>On a Windows machine: while holding "Shift," double click on your iTunes icon in your start menu.  </li></ul></li><li>A “Choose your library” window will pop up. Select “Choose Library.”</li><li>Navigate to the "iTunes 1" or "iTunes 2" (depending on if you're on Mac or a Window's machine) folder on your iPhone or iPod and select "Open"</li><li>iTunes will launch</li><li> The actual iTunes library will be empty, this is ok.  We aren't adding things to the iTunes library, just to the iPhone or Ipod library.  Your iPhone or iPod should appear in the left hand column of iTunes.  Click on your iPhone's or iPod's music library to select it.  A playlist should appear in the main iTunes screen with all the music form the iPhone or iPod.<br /></li><li>Drag any music you want into your iPhone's library.  Make sure you drag into your iPhone's or Ipod's library, not the iTunes library (See Screenshot).<br /><ul><li>Since we are loading the library our iPhone or iPod is connected, not the computer's local iTunes library, we have to manually locate music on the computer to be able to add it to our iPhone or iPod:<br /><ul><li>In OS X Navigate to: User>Music>iTunes>iTunes Music</li><li>In Windows Navigate to: My Documents>Music>iTunes>iTunes Music</li></ul></li></ul> </li><li>When you're done getting music safely dissconnect your iPhone or iPod and close iTunes.  </li><li>As a final step, we need to point the computer back to its original iTunes library:<br /><ul><li>On a Mac: while holding "option," double click on your iTunes icon.  </li><li>On a Windows machine: while holding "Shift," double click on your iTunes icon in your start menu.  </li></ul>   </li><li>Navigate to the "iTunes 1" or "iTunes 2" (depending on if you're on Mac or a Window's machine) folder on the local machine's hard drive and select "Open"<br /><ul><li>In OS X Navigate to: User>Music>iTunes</li><li>In Windows Navigate to: My Documents>Music>iTunes</li></ul> </li></ol> <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Getting the New Music Back onto Your Main Computer:<br /></span><br />iTunes won't let you take the music off your iPhone or iPod, so we're going to have to use third party software<span style="font-weight: bold;">.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></span></span><ol><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ipoddisk/">Download iPodDisk</a> (OS X Free Open Source iPod Ripping Software) or <a href="http://www.podtopc.com/downloads.html">Pod to PC</a></li><li>I made a playlist on my iPhone called "New" so I know what to download<br /></li><li>Import all songs from the "New" playlist<br /></li><li>Empty the "New" playlist so that you do not accidentally download the same songs next time you sync.</li></ol><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>
