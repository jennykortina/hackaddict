Since a lot of people seemed to like the idea of streaming their iTunes library to the Wii I decided to figure out how to stream my iPhoto library to my Wii.  I know the Wii has a built in photo viewer, but this is a nice option if you don't want to keep the pictures in multiple locations.  Unfortunately, this one is Mac only guys....sorry Windows and Linux peeps<br /><br />Things you'll need:<ul><li>Nintendo Wii</li><li>iPhoto Library</li><li><a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/Web-iPhoto-Access-Download-14599.html">iPhoto Access</a></li></ul>Let's get started:<ol><li>Make sure you have the latest version of iPhoto installed on your computer.</li><li>Make sure you have the latest version of the Opera browser installed on your Wii.</li><li>Download and install <a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/progDownload/Web-iPhoto-Access-Download-14599.html">iPhoto Access</a>.</li></ol>After you install iPhoto Access:<ol><li>First you want to make sure that your firewall has "Personal Web Sharing" enabled.  To do so, open up system preferences>sharing and under the services tab check the box next to "Personal Web sharing."<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnucImYfV5I/AAAAAAAAAOc/CRb8oabnguI/s1600-h/ishot-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnucImYfV5I/AAAAAAAAAOc/CRb8oabnguI/s320/ishot-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5078824676346517394" border="0"></a><br /></li><li>This next step is optional, but I recommend it.  Since the Wii is not very good at display small text I went ahead and modified the CSS file that the program uses and simply increased the font size for easier readability on the Wii.  The new CSS file can be downloaded here.  Once it's downloaded simply drag and drop it to:<br />Users/your user name/Sites/wipha/skin/orig/wipha.css<br />When it asks if it's ok to replace the existing file say yes.<br /></li><li>It should bring you to the iPhoto Access homepage which will load in your default browser.  Go ahead and bookmark this page so you can easily access it in the future. If it doesn't load for some reason, or you close the window by accident the default address is: http://your local ip address/~your username/wipha/main.php<br />So mine looked like this: http://127.0.0.1/~Jenny/wipha/main.php<your local="" ip="" address=""><br /></your><br /><your local="" ip="" address=""><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnsgKmYfV1I/AAAAAAAAAN8/WuJF54SAx9s/s1600-h/ishot-2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnsgKmYfV1I/AAAAAAAAAN8/WuJF54SAx9s/s320/ishot-2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5078688371264411474" border="0"></a></your></li><li><br /></li><li>It's now time to login for the first time and configure your albums.  The default username and password are admin/admin</li><li>Once your logged in as the admin, click the "admin" button in the upper right hand corner of the browser window to begin configuring your photos.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnshBmYfV2I/AAAAAAAAAOE/LNMkTxFSCD8/s1600-h/ishot-3.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnshBmYfV2I/AAAAAAAAAOE/LNMkTxFSCD8/s320/ishot-3.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5078689316157216610" border="0"><br /><br /></a></li><li>Adding a new photo library is pretty simple.  Under the "Libraries" section enter whatever you like into the Name field, I chose "My Pics," and under the  enter in the location of your iPhoto library.  The default iPhoto library path is: <tt><br />/Users/your user/Pictures/iPhoto Library</tt><user><br /></user><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rnsi5GYfV3I/AAAAAAAAAOM/Gg82_t6sbvE/s1600-h/ishot-6.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rnsi5GYfV3I/AAAAAAAAAOM/Gg82_t6sbvE/s320/ishot-6.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5078691369151584114" border="0"></a><user></user></li><li>After you click the add button, if all went well you are finished.  At this point you can add more users and define their permissions.<br /></li><li>To browse your new library logout and then login back in.  Select the library you want to browse from the drop down menu and the number of pictures you want to view and click the display button.  You can also go back to the portal page at any point by clicking the "New Search" button.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnskUGYfV4I/AAAAAAAAAOU/2Z9vNzTZkjg/s1600-h/ishot-8.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RnskUGYfV4I/AAAAAAAAAOU/2Z9vNzTZkjg/s320/ishot-8.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5078692932519679874" border="0"></a><br /></li></ol>Configuring the Wii:<br /><ol><li>Load the "Internet Channel"</li><li>Click on the "WWW" icon</li><li>Enter in the IP address you wrote down in step 1 of "After You Install iPhoto Access "  <font class="postbody">into the address bar.  In my case it was </font><font class="postbody">"</font>http://127.0.0.1/~Jenny/wipha/main.php<font class="postbody"></font></li><li><font class="postbody">Enter the username and password for the user you created earlier and click the log in button or just use admin/admin. You should see a portal page. Congratulations you are now streaming your iPhoto library to your Wii!!!</font></li></ol> *I also saved the ip address "http://127.0.0.1/~Jenny/wipha/main.php<font class="postbody">" to my favorites and renamed it "My Photos" for easier access.<br /></font>
