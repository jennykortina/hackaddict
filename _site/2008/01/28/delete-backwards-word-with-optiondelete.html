There are two ways you can backwards delete a word out of the box with iterm:Ctrl+wEsc, Ctrl+h or Esc, DeleteFinally, using some unix trickery, I got option+delete working. First, I used the bind command to map Esc, d to backwards delete word. Edit ~/.bash_profile in your favorite text editor and add the line:bind ‘“\M-d”: backward-kill-word’(Make sure you have all those quotes, otherwise it doesn’t work.)Now that you have an escape sequence that doesn’t require the Ctrl key, you can map option+delete to it in iTerm.In iTerm, go to Bookmarks &gt; Manage Profiles. Choose Keyboard Profiles &gt; Global and click the + button to add a key binding. Choose delete from the dropdown, check the option checkbox, and then in the Action: dropdown choose escape sequence.
