I saw that you are interested in using theiPhone to open word and excel documents, and I thought you might liketo know about Box.net’s new iPhone app. The Box app allows users toaccess files stored on Box.net, giving iPhone users the ability tostore and access Word, Excel and PDF documents. Since its stored onBox.net, the iPhone’s fixed memory is no longer a limitation. Ithought you might want to try it out, or write about it.You can try it out here: http://i.box.netIf you don’t have one, be sure to first register for an account at:www.Box.net“After replying to Brian to let him know that I did not have an iPhone he said they also have a demo set up here: http://i.box.net/home/demo for those of us who don’t have an iPhone yet. The demo is slick and I’m pretty sure this software will work on any phone with access to the internet.Post your thoughts to the comments and let us know what you think!" />
