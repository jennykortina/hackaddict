<meta name="description" content="A few days ago I posted how to convert any video from any website to any format using a site called Zamzar. Today I am going to discuss what else Zamzar can do.Zamzar is a free online file conversion tool. Have a mpeg that you need turned a gif? No problem, Zamzar can do it . Or a .mp3 that needs to be turned into .wav? Zamzar can do that too. My favorite feature about Zamzar, other than it being free, is that it runs through a browser so I can use it in any OS (windows at work OS X at home) and I can also use it anywhere that has internet access. It’s a great tool to add to your box even if you don’t need to use it on a daily basis. Converting files can be tedious, finding the correct program, waiting for the file to re encode, but thankfully Zamzar does a great job of simplifying the process.Oh, and to use it all you do is select a file from your local drive or a url and then select what kind of file you want to change it to and enter in your email address. Zamzar then uploads your file, converts it, and emails you a link to the converted file when it’s done. Make sure you download it within 24 hrs though because it will be deleted!" />
