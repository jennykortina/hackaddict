<meta name="description" content="I sell a lot of stuff on Craigslist and have learned a few things that make sales go faster and less painful. Here are some things I’ve learned along the way:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know your product and price it accordingly. You must know your market and know how much your product is worth and can fetch. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always, always post pictures of what you are selling. Posting pictures lets the buyer see the basic condition of the item and it also creates credibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List your phone number. Listing your number lets buyers know you are real and serious about making a deal. (If you don’t want to use your number use an auto expiring one from Craigsnumber).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use astricks like bullets to separate lines on your entries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Say “If you are reading this the item is still available.” Many times people think the item is gone and do not bother emailing or calling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If at all possible, list “Can meet same day.” Once again it shows you are serious about making a deal and adds credibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OBO - or best offer. If you are desperate to sell something, list it a little higher than what you want for it and put OBO at the end of the post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be as specific as possible and be honest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emphasize the good qualities of your product. What sets your weight bench apart from the thirty others? Include extras when possible (Install software on computers, through in a carrying case for a laptop, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are selling something that is customized, write “UPGRADED” next to the feature you added or paid extra for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;" />
