After the song is on your desktop go back to iTunes and delete the clipped version from you iTunes library (It wonâ€™t delete it from your desktop, it will only remove it from iTunes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, go back the song on your desktop and right click on your song and chose â€œGet info.â€  Go to the name and extension section and change the extension from .m4a to .m4r (or you can just change the extension right from your desktop)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the extension is changed simply double click on the file to add it to your iTunes library under the ringtones section.  Sync your phone with iTunes and youâ€™re done!<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;*Remember to go back into iTunes and uncheck your custom start and stop times for the original version of your song.</p>
