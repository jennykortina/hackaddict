<p>For quite awhile now Iâ€™ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for all my bookmarks, and one of the nice things about this is that it has freed up my Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox.  Lately, Iâ€™ve gotten into the habit of using the extra free space for a GTD approach to bookmarking.  Hereâ€™s how I have things set up:<br /><br />I have a delicious tag <b>favs</b> for my most visited bookmarks, and Iâ€™ve add the feed for this tag as a Live Bookmark in my Bookmarks Toolbar Folder as the first item.  These screenshots show how to set something like this up:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RqgXkhKaIqI/AAAAAAAAAE8/mlYVzeP1Btc/s1600-h/Picture+1.png">&lt;img style=â€display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;â€ src=â€http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RqgXkhKaIqI/AAAAAAAAAE8/mlYVzeP1Btc/s400/Picture+1.pngâ€ border=â€0â€ alt=â€â€œid=â€BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5091345294887101090â€ /&gt;</a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RqgXvBKaIrI/AAAAAAAAAFE/x6oZbZof5kc/s1600-h/Picture+2.png">&lt;img style=â€display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;â€ src=â€http://bp0.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RqgXvBKaIrI/AAAAAAAAAFE/x6oZbZof5kc/s400/Picture+2.pngâ€ border=â€0â€ alt=â€â€œid=â€BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5091345475275727538â€ /&gt;</a><br /><br />Tag your favorite stuff something like <b>favs</b>.  Go to your delicious, then go to your <b>favs</b> page.  Click the orange rss button in the Firefox address bar and choose <b>Add RSS feed tagged â€œfavsâ€ as Live Bookmark</b>.  Make sure itâ€™s in your bookmarks toolbar and youâ€™ll have a nice little dropdown of these items.<br /><br />Now you can use the rest of the real estate as a <b>Bookmarks Inbox</b>.<br /><br />Any time I come across a link that looks interesting, I just drag it into my bookmarks toolbar folder.  Then, when I have some free time, I go through all the bookmarks in my toolbar and either delete them or save them do delicious.  This works especially well if youâ€™re on google ig, google reader, or some other page with a lot of links on it.  Instead of opening everything in new tabs, I just drag stuff I might want to check out to my Bookmarks Inbox.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="350"> <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UFLYhdXFwUs" /> &lt;/param&gt; <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UFLYhdXFwUs" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" /> &lt;/embed&gt; </object></p>
