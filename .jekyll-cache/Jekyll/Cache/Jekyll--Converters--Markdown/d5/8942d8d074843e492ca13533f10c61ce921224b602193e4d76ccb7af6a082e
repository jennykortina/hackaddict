After playing with it for a only few short hours it quickly became her favorite electronic, which she now carries around with her everywhere she goes in her purse.<br /><br />I recently moved to NYC and take the mass transit everywhere.  Having something to read with me at all times is essential, and a portable electronic reading device like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/ref=amb_link_6369712_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=15908FZGGRFY8ZNBATEV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=365511101&amp;pf_rd_i=507846?tag=hack-20">Kindle</a> is not only light weight, but also very robust allowing me to download books from virtually anywhere in the world.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI73MA/ref=amb_link_6369712_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=15908FZGGRFY8ZNBATEV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=365511101&amp;pf_rd_i=507846?tag=hack-20"><br />If you would like to learn more about the Kindle (which I highly recommend doing) this link will redirect you to the Amazon page, where you can read what Amazon and other Kindle users have to say.</a></p>
