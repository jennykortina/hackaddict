Itâ€™s definitely one of those services a la cell phone esque.  If you donâ€™t have it you donâ€™t know what you are missing, but once you have it thereâ€™s no going back.   Below Iâ€™ve listed some simple use cases to try to illustrate the power of the service:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#006600;">Paying others - Splitting a lunch bill:</span>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Iâ€™m out to lunch w/friends, one person pays the bill and the rest of us text that person.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;â€œPay Jenny $21.37 for lunch.â€&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jenny receives $21.37 for the bill from all of her friends.  Itâ€™s great b/c it eliminates the friend who says â€œIâ€™ll hit you laterâ€ and then never hits you later.   It also eliminates the need for everyone to have cash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#006600;">Paying others - Cashing in/out of poker night:</span>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When we do poker night, one person is the â€œpotâ€ and we all send them buy in money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; â€œPay Brad $20 for poker buy in.â€  At the end of the night cashing out is super simple, no dealing w/breaking of bills or coins. â€œPay Jenny $11.41 for poker winnings.â€&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this case Brad is the pot.  At the beginning of the night we all send him money, then at the end of the night he sends out the winnings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF0000;">Charging others - picking up laundry</span>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I pick up my brotherâ€™s laundry I charge him for it.  The money is taken directly out of his account b/c he â€œtrustsâ€ me.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;â€œCharge Andrew $13.75 for laundry.â€&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$13.75 comes into my account &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;These are just a few use cases of how to use text message payments to make your life easier.  If you would like to try Venmo, which is in beta, to text message payments please <a href="mailto:%20jennykortina@gmail.com">email me</a> and Iâ€™m friends with the guys who made it, so I can shoot you an invite. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<i>In the comments, tell me how you  use text message payments to make your life easier. </i>&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>
