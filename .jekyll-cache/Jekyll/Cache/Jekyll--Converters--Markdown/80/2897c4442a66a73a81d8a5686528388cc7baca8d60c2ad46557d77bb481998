In fact, itâ€™s at the point where I decided that I needed a home a media server because my external hard drive was just not cutting it anymore.  I decided to build a Linux box running Xubuntu because of the versatility and stability Linux provides, and I found <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/bits/2007/06/05/build_your_own_server/1">a how to article</a> a few weeks back on Digg which outlined the entire process.<br /><br />After the server was up and running I decided that I wanted my computer to auto-mount my Samba drive whenever I was at home.   Using a combination of an AppleScript saved as an application and a free software for OS X, <a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">Home Zone</a>, I was able to have my computer identify when Iâ€™m at home and only launch my Samba drive when Iâ€™m here.<br /><br />Letâ€™s get started:<br /><br />The first thing I did was searched Google and <a href="http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-16189.html">found an AppleScript</a> to mount my Samba drive.  <a href="http://www.divshare.com/download/886266-ce9">It can be downloaded as a .txt here</a> (I canâ€™t paste it into blogger b/c of errors).<br /><br />After I replaced the server information with my own I saved the script as an application and dropped it into my applications folder.  If I had a desktop I could just launch the script every time I booted my computer (system preferences -&gt; accounts -&gt; login items), but since I have a laptop I only wanted the drive to mount when I was at home where the drive is.<br /><br />There are several free location automators for OS X and after trying a few I decided to use <a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">Home Zone</a> because it was the easiest to configure:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install and launch Home Zone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the Home Zone icon in your menu bar and select â€œConfigureâ€&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the â€œZonesâ€ section click the plus arrow and name your new zone (Home in my case).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the â€œTriggersâ€ section click the plus arrow and select the following options:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When â€œallâ€ of the following are available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kind: â€œAirport Networkâ€&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network: â€œYour wireless Network Nameâ€&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check the â€œOnly when connectedâ€ box&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the â€œActions - Entering the Zoneâ€ section click the plus arrow.  Use the following configuration:<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Action: Open File&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drag the Samba mounting AppleScript into the space right below the action pull down menu (it should say â€œDrag any file hereâ€)<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RmqtPWYfVuI/AAAAAAAAANE/j8mgMz0nfAE/s1600-h/ishot-2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RmqtPWYfVuI/AAAAAAAAANE/j8mgMz0nfAE/s400/ishot-2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5074058409404225250" border="0" /></a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Thatâ€™s itâ€¦youâ€™re done!  Now anytime you are on your home network your samba drive will automount.<br /><workgroup><user><pwd><server></server></pwd></user></workgroup></p>
