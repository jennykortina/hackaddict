I".	<p>I just installed Leopard and after setting up <a href="http://hackaddict.blogspot.com/2007/07/skip-to-next-or-previous-word-in-iterm.html" title="hackaddict.net: Skip to Next or Previous Word in iTerm Using Alt / Option + Left or Right Arrow Keys">option left / right arrow in iTerm</a>, I realized that <b>option+delete</b> did not kill the word to the left of my cursor.  I think this somehow worked in my old pre-leopard setup, although I had done nothing to set it up.<br /><br />After lots of searching, I could find no easy way to map iTerm keys to backwards-delete-word because iTerm doesn’t seem to support multiple key sequence bindings.  There are two ways you can backwards delete a word out of the box with iterm:<br /><b>Ctrl+w</b><br /><b>Esc, Ctrl+h</b> or <b>Esc, Delete</b><br /><br />Finally, using some unix trickery, I got <b>option+delete</b> working.  First, I used the <b>bind</b> command to map <b>Esc, d</b> to backwards delete word. Edit <b>~/.bash_profile</b> in your favorite text editor and add the line:<br /><br /><b>bind ‘“\M-d”: backward-kill-word’</b><br /><br />(Make sure you have all those quotes, otherwise it doesn’t work.)<br /><br />Now that you have an escape sequence that doesn’t require the <b>Ctrl</b> key, you can map <b>option+delete</b> to it in iTerm.<br /><br />In iTerm, go to <b>Bookmarks &gt; Manage Profiles</b>.  Choose <b>Keyboard Profiles &gt; Global</b> and click the <b>+</b> button to add a key binding.  Choose <b>delete</b> from the dropdown, check the <b>option</b> checkbox, and then in the <b>Action:</b> dropdown choose <b>escape sequence</b>.  In the text field that appears, type <b>d</b>.  I also checked the <b>High interception priority</b> checkbox for good measure.  <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/R54H-OIm2OI/AAAAAAAAAHc/2AHDK7yF-r8/s1600-h/opt-delete.png">&lt;img style=”display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;” src=”http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/R54H-OIm2OI/AAAAAAAAAHc/2AHDK7yF-r8/s400/opt-delete.png” border=”0” alt=”“id=”BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5160570988540647650” /&gt;</a><br /><br />Hit OK and you’ll notice <b>option+delete</b> now deletes the word to the left of your cursor.  Sweet!</p>
