I"Ä<p>So I showed my brother this quick and painless way to share files between two macs and he was floored.  He immediately told me to write a blog post about it so he could use it for reference.  This can be done wirelessly or wired (if you do it wired just run a regular network cable between the two computers).<br /><br />For this example the computer is running OS X Tiger 10.4.8:<br />1.  Open system preferences on the computer that you want to share files from.<br />2. Under the Internet and Network section open the â€œSharingâ€ folder.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RYHyZnxxCOI/AAAAAAAAAA8/Z6YszCumsuc/s1600-h/sys.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RYHyZnxxCOI/AAAAAAAAAA8/Z6YszCumsuc/s320/sys.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5008550782601070818" border="0" /></a><br />3.  On the right hand side of the sharing folder there should be a prompt stating â€œPersonal File Sharing is Off.â€  (You should always turn personal file sharing off when youâ€™re not using to protect your personal information).  Under the prompt there should be a button that says â€œStart.â€  Click the start button.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RYHzBHxxCPI/AAAAAAAAABE/DVjdtytOJcQ/s1600-h/off.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RYHzBHxxCPI/AAAAAAAAABE/DVjdtytOJcQ/s320/off.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5008551461205903602" border="0" /></a>4. Now that you are sharing your personal files the other mac (and any other computer around you) can see your public folder.  User/Public  Anything you put in that folder your friend will be able to get.<br />5. After your done sharing always, always turn file sharing off.</p>
