Unfortunately, when you click on one picture that is in the same folder as the rest of the pictures, Preview doesn’t automatically recognize the photo is a part of a set and let you scroll through them all at once (you have to open each one individually).<br /><br />To open photos as a set in preview all you have to do is:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highlight all of them (click the first picture in the set and while holding shift click the last photo in the set)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right click on them (crtl+click)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chose “Open with” &gt; Preview<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;<img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5103819688534450722" src="/assets/images/2007-08-28-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; " /></p>
