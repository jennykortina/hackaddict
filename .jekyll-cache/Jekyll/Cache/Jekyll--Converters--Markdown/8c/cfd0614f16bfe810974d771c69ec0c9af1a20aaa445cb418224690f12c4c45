I"Œ<p>I recently came across <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925&amp;hl=en">this video</a> about processing your email inbox quickly and efficiently.  Itâ€™s a talk that Merlin Man (from <a href="http://43folders.com">43 folders</a>) gave at google and it contains some pretty useful tips about productivity in general, including a lot of GTD related stuff.  Itâ€™s definitely worth checking out.<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=973149761529535925&amp;hl=en" flashvars="" /> &lt;/embed&gt;</p>
