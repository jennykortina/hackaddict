I"ü<p>A few days ago I posted how to convert any video from any website to any format using a site called <a href="http://www.zamzar.com/">Zamzar</a>.  Today I am going to discuss what else <a href="http://www.zamzar.com/">Zamzar</a> can do.<br /><br />Zamzar is a free online file conversion tool.  Have a mpeg that you need turned a gif?  No problem, Zamzar can do it .  Or a .mp3 that needs to be turned into .wav?  Zamzar can do that too.  My favorite feature about Zamzar, other than it being free, is that it runs through a browser so I can use it in any OS (windows at work OS X at home) and I can also use it anywhere that has internet access.    Itâ€™s a great tool to add to your box even if you donâ€™t need to use it on a daily basis.  Converting files can be tedious, finding the correct program, waiting for the file to re encode, but thankfully Zamzar does a great job of simplifying the process.<br /><br />Oh, and to use it all you do is select a file from your local drive or a url and then select what kind of file you want to change it to and enter in your email address.  Zamzar then uploads your file, converts it, and emails you a link to the converted file when itâ€™s done.  Make sure you download it within 24 hrs though because it will be deleted!</p>
