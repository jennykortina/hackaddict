I"ô<p>I canâ€™t believe I just discovered this today: thereâ€™s an option on my macbook to use two finger clicks for a secondary click.  On my old ibook, I had installed <a href="http://iscroll2.sourceforge.net/">iscroll2</a> and enabled this feature, but I always thought it was a hack and not something supported natively by apple.<br /><br />Anyway, to enable easier right clicks, open <b>System Preferences &gt; Keyboard and Mouse &gt; Trackpad</b> and check â€œPlace two fingers on trackpad and click button for secondary click.â€ No more ctrl clicks!<br /><br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5083710788539698898" src="/assets/images/2007-07-05-image-0000.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /></p>
