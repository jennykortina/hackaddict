I"ø<p>I have a 32‚Äô Westinghouse HDTV sitting right next to my computer which I often hook up to use as a secondary or an external display.  Up until now I had no idea how to make Quicktime full screen on it while using it as a secondary display.<br /><br />Make Quicktime full screen while on a secondary display:<br />1.  Hook up external display<br />2.  Launch Quicktime Pro and open the preferences section<br />3.  In the ‚ÄúFull Screen‚Äù tab simply drag the Quicktime logo to the screen you want to be able to do full screen on.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rey3DYPxbcI/AAAAAAAAAIY/L0MRunmnfEM/s1600-h/ishot-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rey3DYPxbcI/AAAAAAAAAIY/L0MRunmnfEM/s400/ishot-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5038603351796837826" border="0" /></a></p>
