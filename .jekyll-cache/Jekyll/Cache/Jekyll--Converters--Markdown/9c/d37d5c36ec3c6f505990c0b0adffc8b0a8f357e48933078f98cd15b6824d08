I"q<p>I posted about this over on my personal blog, but I told Jenny about this and she thought the hackaddict crowd would dig this:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />1. Create an Amazon affilates link to the product you want to arbitrage. The guy advertising this laptop used this affiliate info: tag=track25-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325<br />   <br />2. Based on the price of the product your advertising, determine how much you’re willing to spend in Google Adwords and setup a campaign using the affiliates link you created above. Be sure to put “amazon.com” in the text of your ad, because this is a trusted vendor and it will help you get clicks.<br />   <br />3. Once you started getting clicks, examine your conversion rate and tweak your ad bids until you’re profitable.  For example, suppose your conversion rate is 2%, ie, 2 out of every 100 people clicking your ad actually buy the laptop. Your ad spend should be .02 (conversion rate) * .04 (referral fee) * 1549.00 (avg. product purchase price) = $1.2392. As long as you spend less than $1.24 / click, you’re making money.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />via <a href="http://blog.kortina.net/post/60003332/how-to-arbitrage-ads-with-amazon-affiliates-and-google-a" title="How to arbitrage ads with Amazon Affiliates and Google Adwords">How to arbitrage ads with Amazon Affiliates and Google Adwords</a></p>
