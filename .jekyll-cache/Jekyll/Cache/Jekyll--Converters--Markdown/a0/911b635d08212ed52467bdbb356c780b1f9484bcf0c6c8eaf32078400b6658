<p>Today I am going to show you guys how to make mp3â€™s into ring tones for your cell phone.  I use this method because itâ€™s free and I get to choose exactly what part of the song I want.  For starters youâ€™re going an mp3 of the song you want to use, iTunes, and a way to get the song from your computer to your phone (I have a Razr with bluetooth and use that, but you could also use a usb cable).<br /><br />Now that you have everything itâ€™s time to load iTunes and being setting it up (This is a tutorial for Mac iTunes, which should be the same for windows with some slight differences on menu locations):<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RY14NoVvirI/AAAAAAAAADk/_1U77JV2L-U/s1600-h/itunes.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 221px; height: 265px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RY14NoVvirI/AAAAAAAAADk/_1U77JV2L-U/s320/itunes.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5011794135895476914" border="0" /></a><br />1. Go to the iTunes menu, Preferencesâ€¦, Advanced, and then click on the importing tab.<br />2. On the â€œImport Usingâ€ select â€œMP3 encoderâ€ from the drop down menu.<br />3. Next go to the â€œSettingâ€ drop down menu and select â€œCustom.â€<br />4. Change stereo bit rate to 64 kbps and leave everything else the same.  Click ok.<br /><br />You are now done with all the prep work aka the â€œhard part.  â€œ Itâ€™s time to select which part of the song you want to be your ring tone and actually make the ring tone.<br /><br />1. Right click on the song you are going to make into a ringer and select â€œGet Info.â€<br />2.Go to the options tab and go down to the â€œStart Timeâ€ and â€œStop Timeâ€ check boxes.  Check both boxes and input the time you want your ringer to start/stop.  Click ok when youâ€™re done.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RY16HoVvisI/AAAAAAAAADs/QXxByxt0uCM/s1600-h/song.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 233px; height: 215px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RY16HoVvisI/AAAAAAAAADs/QXxByxt0uCM/s320/song.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5011796231839517378" border="0" /></a><br />3.  Highlight your newly â€œclippedâ€ song and go up to the advanced tab.  Click â€œConvert Selection to MP3.â€  The song will be re-encoded using the start and stop times determined.<br />4. Congratulations, youâ€™re done!  Navigate to your iTunes Music folder, locate your song, and transfer it to your phone (via bluetooth or usb).<br />*Remember to go back into iTunes and uncheck your custom start and stop times for the original version of your song.</p>
