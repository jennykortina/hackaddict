After the initial set up, which didn’t go as smoothly as every other Apple product I’ve set up, I was extremely disappointed with the slow file transfer and constant disconnects I was encountering.  I couldn’t even stream my iTunes library (which is why I got it).<br /><br />Here are some tweaks I’ve done:<br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce Interference:<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connect the Time Capsule directly to your router with a LAN cable, then log into it via the Airport utility.  Click on the manual set up button, then the wireless tab to disable wireless and give her a reboot.  When the Time Capsule restarts it should now say “Wired” in the connection status. - Please note, I live in an apartment with 20 or so wireless networks around me, which was causing major interference.  After hard wiring the Time Capsule I no longer have drop outs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rename your Time Capsule to a single word, mine is named Tera. Don’t use weird symbols either, straight up letters and numbers here folks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speed her up!<br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disable searchlight indexing.  Go into system preferences, spotlight, privacy and add your time capsule to the list “Prevent Spolight from Searching these Locations”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following suite, I removed the Time capsule from Quicksilver’s catalog - before I did this Quicksilver would crash or freeze when I tried to use it when my Time Capsule was connected, now I can use both in harmony&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;After performing all my tweaks, I can now stream iTunes music and videos and quickly update my iPhone and iPods!  I haven’t had any disconnects either.<br /><br />Please post any other tweaks to the comments.</p>
