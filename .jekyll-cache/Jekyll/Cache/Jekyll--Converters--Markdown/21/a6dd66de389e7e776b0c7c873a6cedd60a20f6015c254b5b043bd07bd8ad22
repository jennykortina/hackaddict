I just installed it and it is simply amazing.  It ads a loading screen to Firefox, which normally takes forever to load on my intel mac, but after I added the extension Firefox booted almost instantaneously.  Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s the loading window that makes it seem like Firefox is booting faster, but either way it seems faster to me and Iâ€™ll take it.<br /><br />(It works with most Mozilla products including: Thunderbird, Firefox, and Sunbird)</p>
