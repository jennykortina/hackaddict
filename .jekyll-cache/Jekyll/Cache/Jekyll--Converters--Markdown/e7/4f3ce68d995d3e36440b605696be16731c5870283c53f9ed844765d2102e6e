I"<p>I recently needed to build a database to track some information.  My brother suggested I use Dabble  DB, an online database solution.  Dabble is free to use as long as you make your databases public data, but if you prefer for a small fee you can keep your data private.<br /><br />&lt;div class="screenshot" id="screenshot1"&gt;    <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/explore/" class="image"><img src="http://www.dabbledb.com/images/screenshots/chart.jpg" alt="Screenshot of chart view" border="0" height="166" width="220" /></a><br /> &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;p id="p1"&gt;<br />“Dabble DB lets you build database applications with no hassle. It’s <strong>easy to use</strong> yet extremely <strong>flexible and powerful</strong>.&lt;/p&gt;Unlike a spreadsheet, you can <strong>save multiple views</strong> of your data from any angle and <strong>re-organize</strong> it on a whim. And you can <strong>share everything with colleagues</strong>.”<br /><a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/explore/7minutedemo/"><br />Click here to view a 7 minute demo video (definitely worth watching, it’s pretty amazing).</a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/RqPaxegnQDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/1-AsLpNej0o/s1600-h/logo3.png"><br /></a></p>
