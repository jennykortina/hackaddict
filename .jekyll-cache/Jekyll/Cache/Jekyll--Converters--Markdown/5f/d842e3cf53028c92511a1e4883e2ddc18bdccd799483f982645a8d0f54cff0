I"#	<p>Today I am going to show you guys how to make mp3’s into ring tones for your cell phone.  I use this method because it’s free and I get to choose exactly what part of the song I want.  For starters you’re going an mp3 of the song you want to use, iTunes, and a way to get the song from your computer to your phone (I have a Razr with bluetooth and use that, but you could also use a usb cable).<br /><br />Now that you have everything it’s time to load iTunes and being setting it up (This is a tutorial for Mac iTunes, which should be the same for windows with some slight differences on menu locations):<br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5011794135895476914" src="/assets/images/2006-12-23-image-0000.jpg" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right;  width: 221px; height: 265px;" /><br />1. Go to the iTunes menu, Preferences…, Advanced, and then click on the importing tab.<br />2. On the “Import Using” select “MP3 encoder” from the drop down menu.<br />3. Next go to the “Setting” drop down menu and select “Custom.”<br />4. Change stereo bit rate to 64 kbps and leave everything else the same.  Click ok.<br /><br />You are now done with all the prep work aka the “hard part.  “ It’s time to select which part of the song you want to be your ring tone and actually make the ring tone.<br /><br />1. Right click on the song you are going to make into a ringer and select “Get Info.”<br />2.Go to the options tab and go down to the “Start Time” and “Stop Time” check boxes.  Check both boxes and input the time you want your ringer to start/stop.  Click ok when you’re done.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5011796231839517378" src="/assets/images/2006-12-23-image-0001.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 233px; height: 215px;" /><br />3.  Highlight your newly “clipped” song and go up to the advanced tab.  Click “Convert Selection to MP3.”  The song will be re-encoded using the start and stop times determined.<br />4. Congratulations, you’re done!  Navigate to your iTunes Music folder, locate your song, and transfer it to your phone (via bluetooth or usb).<br />*Remember to go back into iTunes and uncheck your custom start and stop times for the original version of your song.</p>
