It’s called <a href="http://pulpsite.net/zontube/">ZonTube</a>.<br /><br />The idea is simple.  Start by browsing huge catalog of music by artist, album, or genre, or just search the catalog for an artist/album/song.  When you find the artist/album you’re looking for, ZonTube brings up a track list, and then makes an ajax request to search YouTube for videos of each track.  If there are YouTube videos for a track, a play button appears next to the track name.<br /><br />Click the play button to view videos of the song.  Sweet!<br /><br />As you can see if you play with this a bit, when you click on a track name, some garbage / unrelated videos come up, but out of the top 6 most of them are usually relevant.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  If you’re searching for a specific video, you may be better off going straight to <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.  But, if you wanna browse around for videos by genre or artist, give ZonTube a shot.</p>
