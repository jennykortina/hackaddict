I"Î<p>So for work I had to make a PowerPoint presentation with video clips in it.  Doesnâ€™t sound too hard right?  I didnâ€™t think so easier.  I was just going to use Snapz to record video clips and then insert those clips right into PowerPoint (Snapz will be reviewed next week for those of you who donâ€™t know what it is).  This method worked great until I tried to play the PowerPoint with itâ€™s videos on a windows computer (Which I tried for the first time in front of a sales seminar - quick tip: donâ€™t try things for the first time in front of a audience).<br /><br />Alright, now down to the nitty gritty.  The easiest way to do convert an mov to an mpeg on a mac is to open the mov in quicktime pro and export it as mp4.  Once the mp4 is encoded go to <a href="http://www.zamzar.com/">Zamzar</a>.  Upload the mp4 and choose to encode it as an mpeg.  It will take a few minutes and when itâ€™s done it will send a link to the file to the email you specified.</p>
