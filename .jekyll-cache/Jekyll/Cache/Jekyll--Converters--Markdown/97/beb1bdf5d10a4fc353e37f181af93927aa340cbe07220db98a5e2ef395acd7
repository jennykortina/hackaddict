I"ø<p>A guy that I went to school with just launched a pretty awesome website called <a href="http://anywhere.fm">anywhere.fm</a>.  Itâ€™s funny that I heard about this yesterday, because 2 days ago I was telling a friend that I could NOT think of a website that I would use that I didnâ€™t already have.  anywhere.fm turned out to be pretty great and I plan on using it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RrEqPxKaItI/AAAAAAAAAFU/GKNXxnySTHw/s1600-h/Picture+2.png">&lt;img style=â€display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;â€ src=â€http://bp0.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RrEqPxKaItI/AAAAAAAAAFU/GKNXxnySTHw/s400/Picture+2.pngâ€ border=â€0â€ alt=â€â€œid=â€BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093899103916139218â€ /&gt;</a><br /><br />Basically, itâ€™s a flex version of itunes that runs in your browser.  Itâ€™s free, and you can upload as much music as you want to your account and then stream it anywhere by just logging into the site.  They also have a bulk uploader you can install on OS X or Windows in case you want to upload a lot of music.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RrEqERKaIsI/AAAAAAAAAFM/bxIeG07hwoA/s1600-h/Picture+1.png">&lt;img style=â€display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;â€ src=â€http://bp2.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RrEqERKaIsI/AAAAAAAAAFM/bxIeG07hwoA/s400/Picture+1.pngâ€ border=â€0â€ alt=â€â€œid=â€BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5093898906347643586â€ /&gt;</a><br /><br />Finally, there are a few social features.  You can have friends and listen to their music as well, but the catch is you canâ€™t see their playlists or choose directly which of their songs you want to listen to.  You can just listen to their stuff in shuffle mode.  (Honestly, Iâ€™m not even sure how thatâ€™s legal.)<br /><br />In short, this service looks pretty fantastic, but my only reservation is that thereâ€™s no obvious business model for this.  I have no idea how they will pay for the bandwidth and storage costs and keep the service free.  However, it is free now, so check it out:<br /><br /><a href="http://anywhere.fm">anywhere.fm</a></p>
