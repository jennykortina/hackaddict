I"â<p>I have a pretty horrible short term memory, so whenever I think of something that I need to remember for later I like to jot it down on a scrap of paper.  I was addicted to <a href="http://www.pocketmod.com/">pocketmod</a> for a long time, but now that I no longer have reliable access to a printer, I had to come up with a new notepad.</p>
<p>I tried <a href="http://www.moleskineus.com/">moleskine</a> and 8.5x11 sheets folded in quarters, but both of these require you to carry a pen with you.  Since I'm already always carrying my phone, keys, and wallet, I don't particularly like adding a notebook and pen to my already full pockets.</p>
<p>If my phone, a Samsung Blackjack, played a little nicer with my Macbook, I would use it more for writing notes and such.  But even with <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_windowsmobile.php">Missing Sync</a>, it's a pain in the ass to make my phone do anything with my laptop.</p>
<p>Here's the solution I finally came up with to easily use my phone to jot notes for myself: <b>Post notes to gmail via text message</b></p>
<p>I wanted to make this as easy as possible, so I created an address book entry on my phone just for this purpose.  I named it <b>NNnotes</b>, so I can just tap <b>N</b> 3 times to bring it up.  The only contact info associated with this entry is my gmail plus a flag I use for filtering the notes once they arrive in gmail:</p>
<p><b>myGmailName+notes@gmail.com</b></p>
<p>You can append anything you want after the plus sign, but I kept it simple and used notes.  I think I originally heard about this technique on Diggnation or TechTv, but googling for more info lead me to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/gmail/instant-disposable-gmail-addresses-144397.php">this lifehacker post</a> where you can read a bit more about making disposable gmail aliases.</p>
<p>Also, you don't need a gmail account for this to work.  You can make a shortcut in your address book for any email address and send text / mms messages to it.</p>
