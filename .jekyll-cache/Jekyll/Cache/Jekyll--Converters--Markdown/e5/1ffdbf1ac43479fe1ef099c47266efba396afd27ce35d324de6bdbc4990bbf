After a  lengthy argue-sation  with my brother I finally crumbled.   Although it fit the subject manner Getting High on Getting By was just too long of a name.  We wanted to keep the same feel, but get a shorter name.  We tossed around a few ideas and finally landed on Hack Addict - short, sweet, and to the point.<br /><br />Today’s Lesson:  Just because you like the name of your product doesn’t mean it’s the best name for it.  Always sacrifice personal personal preference for marketability.<br />KISS - Keep it Simple Stupid</p>
