I"ô<p>One thing I have always found kind of annoying about <a href="http://blogger.com">blogger</a> is that you canâ€™t get RSS feeds for a particular label or author.  Today, I wanted to import my <a href="http://hackaddict.net" title="hackaddict.net">hackaddict</a> posts into Facebook Notes, but I didnâ€™t want to take credit for my sisterâ€™s work, so I had to come up with a way to make an RSS Feed of only the posts I authored.<br /><br />To do this, I used <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com" title="Pipes: Rewire the web">Yahoo Pipes</a>, a pretty cool tool for mixing / manipulating / mashing up RSS and atom feeds.  First, I made a new Pipe and used the <b>Fetch Feed</b> tool to add as a source the hackaddict feed: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hackaddict" title="hackaddict.net">http://feeds.feedburner.com/hackaddict</a>.<br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075774805763213330" src="/assets/images/2007-06-14-image-0000.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /><br /><br />Then, I piped this through the <b>Filter Operator</b> and blocked out items written by jenny.  (I also could have done the opposite and permitted items only by me.  Thatâ€™s how you would do it if there were more than 2 authors and you wanted only one personâ€™s posts.)<br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075774968971970594" src="/assets/images/2007-06-14-image-0001.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /><br /><br />Then I just sent this into <b>Pipe Output</b>, Saved, and published everything, and I had an RSS feed of my posts: <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=HLB4uisa3BGDG3tTJphxuA" title="Pipes: kortina's hackaddict posts">http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=HLB4uisa3BGDG3tTJphxuA</a>.<br /><br />(&lt;h4&gt;My thoughts on pipes&lt;/h4&gt;<br />Itâ€™s pretty cool and powerful, but a bit difficult to figure out.  Also, it would be nice if they provided a way to use the tool programmatically without the GUI.  Definitely worth checking out, but only if you have some time on your hands.<br />) <br /><br />To import into <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook | Incompatible Browser">Facebook</a> Notes, you need to click the Notes Application in your sidebar, then <b>Edit Import Settings</b> under <b>Notes Settings</b> in the right sidebar of the Notes Page.  Once there, you just enter in an RSS feed url, and your blog posts will be imported as Notes on Facebook.<br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075775175130400818" src="/assets/images/2007-06-14-image-0002.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075775402763667522" src="/assets/images/2007-06-14-image-0003.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5075775527317719122" src="/assets/images/2007-06-14-image-0004.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /></p>
