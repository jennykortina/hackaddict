It‚Äôs a tiny lightweight plugin for OS X that makes connecting to reliable wireless networks quicker and easier.  Whether you‚Äôre at home, the office or at your favorite cafe - WiFind will help you locate a signal and start browsing!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;If you‚Äôre on the move a lot, like I am, the $8 price tag is well worth it in saved time alone.  No longer do you have randomly click on networks until you hopefully find an open one.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tastyapps.com/">Wifind can be downloaded here.</a></p>
