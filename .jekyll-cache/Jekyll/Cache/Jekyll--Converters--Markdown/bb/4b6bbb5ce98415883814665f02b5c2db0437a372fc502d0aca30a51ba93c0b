I"ù<div>My Airplay icon went missing from both my iPhone and iPad.  Luckily it's an easy, but weird fix to get it back.  You need to change your phone language from English -&gt; French (or any other language) -&gt; English.  To do this:</div>
<div><ol><li>Settings&gt;General&gt;International&gt;Language</li><li>Select "Francais" and click done.  iPad/iPhone/iPod will change over to new language.</li><li>Repeat steps one and two but change device back to English.</li><li>Settings&gt;General&gt;International&gt;Keyboards</li><li>Click "edit"</li><li>Delete the non-English keyboard</li></ol><div>Now go try to play media.  Your Airplay icon will be back!</div></div>
