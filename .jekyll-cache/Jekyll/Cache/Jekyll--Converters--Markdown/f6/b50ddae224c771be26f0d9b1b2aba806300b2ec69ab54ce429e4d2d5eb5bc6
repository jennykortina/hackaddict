So for the past couple of months Iâ€™ve been lurking at The Apple Blog, posting my typcial hackaddict articles, bu over there.  You can check out my Apple Blog posts here:<br /><br />http://theappleblog.com/author/jenny/<br /><br />So if itâ€™s so great at The Apple Blog, why I am back?  Good questionâ€¦although The Apple Blog is fantastic, it is unfortunately only about Apple.  This being said, all of non-apple related posts have no where to go and are getting lonely.  So folks, hackaddict is officially revived (and we are right on time for Halloweenâ€¦spooky).</p>
