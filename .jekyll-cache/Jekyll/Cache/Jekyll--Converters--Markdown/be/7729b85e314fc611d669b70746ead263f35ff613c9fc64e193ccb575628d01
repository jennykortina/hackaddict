I"ó<p>Something I just learned, but have wanted to know for so long:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;you can access the menubar from keyboard by pressing CTRL + F2.&lt;/blockquote&gt; via a comment on<br /><a href="http://iboughtamac.com/2007/01/13/useful-keyboard-shortcuts-in-os-x/">this post</a>.<br /><br /><br />Make sure full-keyboard access is turned on in order for this to work.  From another comment on the same post: &lt;blockquote&gt;the â€˜Full Keyboard Accessâ€™ option in the System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &amp; Mouse screen. If you open up your prefs and go to the Keyboard &amp; Mouse Prefs, then click â€œKeyboardâ€ tab. Than set the full keyboard access to â€œAll Controlsâ€ This gives you tab control in dialogs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
