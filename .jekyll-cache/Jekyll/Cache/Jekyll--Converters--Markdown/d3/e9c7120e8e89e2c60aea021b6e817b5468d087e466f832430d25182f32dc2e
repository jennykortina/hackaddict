I"@<p>I don’t know if anyway uses myspace anymore, but I came across a pretty cool CSS trick the other day that I thought I’d post here.  <br /><br />In his <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/04/hacking-myspace-layouts" title="Mike Davidson: Hacking A More Tasteful MySpace">post on hacking myspace layouts</a>, Mike Davidson explains how to increase your friends count to the billions with the following CSS:<br /><b><br /> .redbtext:after { content: “ billion”;}<br /></b><br />I decided to do something similar:<br /><b><br /> .redbtext:after {content: “997354”; }<br /></b><br />Check out the result:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RnIOLxFkyGI/AAAAAAAAACs/LKd8AUT-f8w/s1600-h/Picture+1.png">&lt;img style=”display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;” src=”http://bp3.blogger.com/_3FPfpXHnCwA/RnIOLxFkyGI/AAAAAAAAACs/LKd8AUT-f8w/s400/Picture+1.png” border=”0” alt=”“id=”BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5076135325318039650” /&gt;</a><br /><br />(Aside: I never was a big fan of Myspace–maybe because I was on Facebook first–but there it seems that now are lots of slicker alternatives (virb, vox, etc.).  Anyone got suggestions for other cool social sites to check out?)</p>
