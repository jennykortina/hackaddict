This <b>built in tool</b> that comes with OS X is definitely one of the most awesome hidden features of OS X Iâ€™ve found.  Here is a video demo: <br /><br /><a href="http://www.screencast.com/users/kortina/folders/Jing/media/02b87105-9968-417f-8c16-13687ca169d4">http://www.screencast.com/users/kortina/folders/Jing/media/02b87105-9968-417f-8c16-13687ca169d4</a><br /><br />In short, this tool allows you to get the hex value of <b>any color</b> from <b>any app</b> and put it into your clipboard.  So if youâ€™re looking at screenshots in Preview and need to find a certain color blue or red, you donâ€™t need to open Photoshop and use the eyedropper.  Just open <b>DigitalColor Meter</b> by going to <br /><b>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; DigitalColor Meter</b><br /><br />The first time you use this app, you need to change the default output setting to make this useful for CSS editing.  From the dropdown box in the app, select <b>RGB As Hex-Value, 8 bit</b>.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5186363910323665954" src="/assets/images/2008-04-06-image-0001.png" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center; " /><br /><br /><br />Now, move your mouse over the color you want to grab (in Firefox, Preview, Word, or whatever) and hit <b>cmd + shift + c</b>.  This will copy the hex value of the color to your clipboard, and you can then easily paste it into a CSS document.<br /><br />This is so freakin sweet!</p>
