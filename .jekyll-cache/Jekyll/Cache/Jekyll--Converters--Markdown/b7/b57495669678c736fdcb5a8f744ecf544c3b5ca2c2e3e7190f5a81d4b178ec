I"ú<p>This is pretty hilarious:<br /><a href="http://www.twit.tv/104">Twit 104</a>.  Scott Jordan of SeV investigated the company that provides the â€œHacker Safeâ€ images you see on a lot of websites and found out that they didnâ€™t really do much other than give you a sticker that made your customers feel safe (think placebo effect).<br /><br />So he made his own image with â€œHacker Proofâ€ on it and they ended up suing him.<br /><br />Both phrases are pretty funny, and props to Scott for coming up with such a great spoof.  Also, funny how context matters: places like <a href="http://lifehacker.com">lifehacker</a> and hackaddict treat hacker endearingly, but to most people itâ€™s a warning flag.<br /><br />Check out the podcast.  Worth a listen.</p>
