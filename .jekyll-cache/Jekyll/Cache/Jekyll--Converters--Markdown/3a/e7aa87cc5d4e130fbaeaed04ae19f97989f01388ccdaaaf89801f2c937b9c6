I"İ<p>Iâ€™m a fairly busy individual whoâ€™s organizational skills are about as a good as a koalaâ€™s.  Thankfully for me Gmail calendar has the ability to text message me reminders.<br /><br />First you need to set up Gcalendar so it can send you messages:<br />1.  Click on Gcalendarâ€™s â€œsettingsâ€ tab<br />2. Click on â€œnotificationsâ€<br />3. On the lower half of the notifications window there is a section called â€œnofity me on my cell phone.â€<br />4. Ok, all you have do now is select your country, enter in your phone number, and select your cell phone carrier from a pull down menu.  After you have entered in all your information click â€œsend verification code.â€<br />5. In about one minute you will get a text message from Google with a number in it.  Take the number they sent you and enter it into the â€œVerification Codeâ€ spot under the â€œnotify my on my cell phoneâ€ section of the notification set up for Gcalendar.<br />6. If you did everything correctly your status should now be â€œPhone number succesffully validated.â€<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rew9Hitj5II/AAAAAAAAAIA/EtOPDCX9Za0/s1600-h/ishot-6.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rew9Hitj5II/AAAAAAAAAIA/EtOPDCX9Za0/s400/ishot-6.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5038469282907022466" border="0" /></a><br />Now, making events message you:<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rew93ytj5JI/AAAAAAAAAII/Vwc3zt7KC0E/s1600-h/ishot-3.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_Gj3xvk4ycVs/Rew93ytj5JI/AAAAAAAAAII/Vwc3zt7KC0E/s320/ishot-3.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5038470111835710610" border="0" /></a><br />1.  Create a new event on one of of your Gcalendars<br />2. Click â€œedit event details.â€<br />3. Under the â€œoptionsâ€section set the reminder time to something other than 10 minutes (I usually set it to a day).<br />4. Click â€œsaveâ€ at the bottom of the page.  Google will send you a text message at the time you specified.</p>
