Using the apostrophe to search will search the text of all the links on a page, and highlight each link with a dotted line as it matches that link.  This allows you to follow the link by hitting <b>Enter</b> and is a great way to avoid using the mouse for all of you who love keyboard navigation.  Try it out next time you need to change cities on <a href="http://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>.</p>
