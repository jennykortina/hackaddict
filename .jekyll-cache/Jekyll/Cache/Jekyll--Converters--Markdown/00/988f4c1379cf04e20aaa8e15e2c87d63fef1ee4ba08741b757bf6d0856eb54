<p><br /><br />Most pets have an RFID chip in them so when they are lost it can be scanned and the owners information can be retrieved. Â I would like to harness the power of this RFID technology to allow my pet, Chewie, to control my house and update her <a href="https://twitter.com/chewie">Twitter</a>.<br /><br />Iâ€™ve learned that pet RFID transmits at 125 kHz. Â I had an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/789?gclid=CjwKEAiAwfzDBRCRmJe7z_7h8yQSJAC4corOJONSGGLzh3dEtnacayOyRUu6bWYM0J6RAjbVgVL-JhoCvTnw_wcB">RFID reader</a> lying around from Adafruit, that I doubted and confirmed could not read Chewieâ€™s RFID chip. Â Iâ€™ve order a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J9AYFGG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">125 kHz Arduino </a>compatible reader that should arrive on Friday. Â Will update blog in a few days with the results of the new reader.<br /><br />Github project <a href="https://github.com/jennykortina/chaosPuppy">here</a>. Â Until next time.</p>
