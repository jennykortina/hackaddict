I"¨<p>If you work in the terminal a lot, like I do, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve typed in a long command and misspelled something or forgotten a flag along the way.  If you just forgot to sudo, or do something at the beginning of the command, just press <b>UP ARROW</b> to recall the command and <b>CTRL+A</b> to return to the beginning of the line.<br /><br />If you made the mistake in the beginning of the line, itâ€™s a bit more of a pain in the ass to get there.  You can either hold <b>LEFT ARROW</b> til you get where you want (annoying) or use <b>ESC-B</b> to go back one word at a time.<br /><br />While I was looking up the key command for back one word, however, I discovered this awesome trick:  you can set your terminal to position the cursor with an <b>OPTION(ALT) + MOUSECLICK</b> by opening Terminal and setting a preference in <b>Terminal &gt; Window Settings &gt; Emulation &gt; Option click to position cursor.</b><br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5018787787173115218" src="/assets/images/2007-01-11-image-0000.png" style="" /><br /><br />Via: <a href="http://www.freesmug.org/tutorial/tips/terminalkey">http://www.freesmug.org/tutorial/tips/terminalkey</a></p>
