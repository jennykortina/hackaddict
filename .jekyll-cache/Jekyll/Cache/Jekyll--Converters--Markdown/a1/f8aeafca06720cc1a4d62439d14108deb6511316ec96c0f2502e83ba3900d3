I"´<p>Iâ€™m working on a few Firefox extensions, and I came across a pretty slick tool that generates a skeleton for your extension:<br /><br /><a href="http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/extensionwiz/" title="Firefox/Thunderbird Extension Wizard">Firefox / Thunderbird Extension Generator</a><br /><br />You put in some basic info about your extension and it generates a zip file with the skeleton for your extension.  For some reason, whenever I double-clicked this zip in OS X and Stuff-it tried to expand the zip, I got this error:<br /><br /><b>An error occurred attempting to expand â€˜extension.zipâ€™.  Format error.  Error #17540.</b><br /><br />After about 15 minutes of frustrating attempts to rebuild the extension all resulting in the same error, I just tried opening the file from the command line:<br /><br />&lt;pre&gt;$ cd downloads&lt;/pre&gt;<br />&lt;pre&gt;$ unzip extension.zip&lt;/pre&gt;<br /><br />This did the trick.</p>
