I"<p>Google Analytics is probably the most essential tool for anyone running a webservice, blog, or other online property that wants to grow traffic and understand existing traffic.<br /><br />I’ve been searching for quite some time for a good way to access Google Analytics from the iPhone, have tried a few apps that just didn’t cut it, but found yesterday (via @brit) an app that actually works.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5304893358255506066" src="/assets/images/2009-02-20-image-0000.jpg" style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;  width: 267px; height: 400px;" /><br /><br />The <a href="http://bit.ly/iphoneGAnalytics">Analytics App</a> gives you access to all your different sites in Google Analytics, so it’s perfect if you manage many different accounts like I do.  Plus, it has all your favorite analytics reports:<br />* Dashboard Summaries<br />* Length of Visit<br />* Browsers and OS<br />* Referring Sites<br />* Keywords<br />* Adwords Campaigns<br />* Content Reports<br />* Top Landing Pages<br />* Top Exit Pages<br />* Custom Event Tracking<br />* Plus, pretty much every other report from Google Analytics<br /><br />You can view reports by date range, too. I’ve found it most useful to set the Date range to the Past Day to get a quick summary of what’s happening on my sites right now.<br /><br />I’m loving this app. Check it out at: <a href="http://bit.ly/iphoneGAnalytics">http://bit.ly/iphoneGAnalytics</a><br /><br />&lt;div class="zemanta-pixie" style="margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;"&gt;<img alt="Reblog this post [with Zemanta]" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_c.png?x-id=9b7925ca-2367-403b-986a-42aeca28c0a0" style="border: medium none ; float: right;" />&lt;/div&gt;</p>
