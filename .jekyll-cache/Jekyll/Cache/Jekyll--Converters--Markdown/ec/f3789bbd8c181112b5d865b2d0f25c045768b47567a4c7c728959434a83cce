I"ò<p>I sell a lot of stuff on Craigslist and have learned a few things that make sales go faster and less painful.  Here are some things Iâ€™ve learned along the way:<br />&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know your product and price it accordingly.  You must know your market and know how much your product is worth and can fetch. <br />&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always, always post pictures of what you are selling.  Posting pictures lets the buyer see the basic condition of the item and it also creates credibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List your phone number.  Listing your number lets buyers know you are real and serious about making a deal. (If you donâ€™t want to use your number use an auto expiring one from <a href="http://www.craigsnumber.com/">Craigsnumber</a>).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use astricks like bullets to separate lines on your entries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Say â€œIf you are reading this the item is still available.â€  Many times people think the item is gone and do not bother emailing or calling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If at all possible, list â€œCan meet same day.â€  Once again it shows you are serious about making a deal and adds credibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OBO - or best offer.  If you are desperate to sell something, list it a little higher than what you want for it and put OBO at the end of the post.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be as specific as possible and be honest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emphasize the good qualities of your product.  What sets your weight bench apart from the thirty others?  Include extras when possible (Install software on computers, through in a carrying case for a laptop, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are selling something that is customized, write â€œUPGRADEDâ€ next to the feature you added or paid extra for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
